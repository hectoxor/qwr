Labor Economics Concepts Explained

1. Trade-off between leisure and consumption
Households have limited time (24 hours per day) that must be divided between work and leisure. Working produces income for buying goods and services (consumption), while leisure provides direct enjoyment. Every hour spent relaxing is an hour not earning money, creating a fundamental trade-off: more leisure means less consumption, and more consumption requires sacrificing leisure time.

2. Higher wages increase labor supply for regular households
When wages increase for average households, each hour of work becomes more financially rewarding. The opportunity cost of leisure rises (that hour of relaxation "costs" more in potential earnings). This encourages people to work more hours to take advantage of better pay. Essentially, the financial incentive of higher wages outweighs the desire for free time for most regular workers.

3. Higher wages decrease labor supply for billionaires
For extremely wealthy individuals, higher wages often have the opposite effect. Since billionaires already have enormous wealth, their desire for additional income is less pressing. When their wages increase, they can maintain their luxurious lifestyle while working fewer hours. The value they place on free time exceeds the value of additional income. They essentially "buy back" their time when their earnings power increases further.
