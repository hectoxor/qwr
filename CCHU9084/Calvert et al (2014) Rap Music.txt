Rap Music and the True Threats Quagmire: When Does One
Man’s Lyric Become Another’s Crime?
By Clay Calvert,* Emma Morehart** and Sarah Papadelias***
ABSTRACT
This Article examines the complex and unsettled state of the true threats
doctrine through the lens of the equally complicated, controversial and multifaceted musical genre of rap. Rap, although generally protected by the First
Amendment, is frequently caught in the crosshairs of criminal prosecutions
focusing on whether or not it constitutes a true threat of violence. Ultimately, this
Article offers suggestions for how to clarify the doctrinal issues, with rap
illustrating and supporting those ideas.
INTRODUCTION
In analyzing whether the First Amendment guarantee of free speech1 safeguards
the right to wear a jacket emblazoned with the expletive-imbued message “Fuck the
Draft” in a public courthouse, the Supreme Court wrote more than forty years ago
in Cohen v. California that “one man’s vulgarity is another’s lyric.”2 Professor
Alex Long recently pointed out that “the success and widespread appeal of gangsta
rap proves Justice John Marshall Harlan’s observation in Cohen.”3 But the Cohen
aphorism also illustrates a more pernicious problem when it comes to the
intersection of rap lyrics and the First Amendment. In particular, the maxim

demonstrates the difficulty of distinguishing between protected, artistic musical
expression4 and unprotected threats of violence.5
The relevance of this problem is more than academic or speculative. While it is
clear that rap music generally is protected by the First Amendment,6 rap lyrics
sometimes constitute unprotected threats of violence.7 In November 2013, for
instance, two Pennsylvania men—twenty-two-year-old Rashee Beasley and
nineteen-year-old Jamal Knox—were convicted of making terroristic threats based
on a rap video that named two police officers who had previously arrested Beasley
and Knox.8 Allegheny County Judge Jeffrey Manning concluded the video was
“not protected by the First Amendment because it far exceeds what the First
Amendment allows.”9
The video, which was posted on YouTube in 2012, “mentions convicted cop
killer Richard Poplawski and advocates killing city officers.”10 The song included,
among others, the lyrics “let’s kill these cops ‘cause they don’t do us no good”11
and “[w]ell, your shift over at 3, and I’m gonna [expletive] up where you sleep.”12
The video included two photographs, one featuring Beasley and Knox, who rapped
under the stage names Mayhem Mal and Soulja Beaz, “posing in white shirts and
another showing them posing in camouflage inside a convenience store.”13
This case is not isolated. In 2011, a twenty-six-year-old aspiring rapper named
Olutosin Oduwole was sentenced to five years in prison for what he maintained

another exception to First Amendment protection for rap music would occur if the lyrics were held to be
obscene. See Luke Records, Inc. v. Navarro, 960 F.2d 134, 138í39 (11th Cir. 1992) (reversing an

Amendment”).

“were merely possible lyrics for a rap song.”14 In March 2013, however, an Illinois
appellate court reversed Oduwole’s conviction for attempting to make a terrorist
threat.15 The appellate court noted that an expert witness, Dr. Charis Kubrin of the
University of CaliforniaíIrvine, testified that the writings in question “constituted
the formative stages of a rap song.”16
Numerous other courts in the past three years, in fact, addressed similar issues
arising either at or near the intersection of rap lyrics and true threats,17 including
the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in September 2013 in United States v.
Elonis.18 As counsel for Anthony Elonis noted to the Supreme Court in the petition
for a writ of certiorari, the online postings that landed Elonis in trouble with the law
were “frequently in the form of rap lyrics” and “the language was—as with popular
rap songs addressing the same themes—sometimes violent.”19
This spate of cases may seem somewhat surprising because it has been more
than twenty years since Ice-T’s metal band, Body Count, released “Cop Killer”20—
a song, described by one federal appellate court as a “virulent rap song,”21 that

caused cultural controversy with lyrics such as “I’m ‘bout to bust some shots off /
I’m ‘bout to dust some cops off” and “fuck the police.”22 Indeed, as Professor
Linda McClain wrote back in 1994 regarding the turmoil caused by that song, “The
controversy over rap lyrics is part of a larger debate over representations of
violence and the alleged link to violent and other anti-social behavior, particularly
when an audience of young people and the possibility of imitative conduct are
involved.”23 But deciding what constitutes a true threat of violence and in
particular when rap lyrics constitute such a threat remains unsettled.
True threats, which represent one of only a handful of categories of speech
falling outside the ambit of First Amendment protection,24 are defined generally by
the Supreme Court as “those statements where the speaker means to communicate a
serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular
individual or group of individuals.”25 As this Article illustrates, however, the true
threats doctrine today is plagued by disagreements among lower courts over
nuances that arguably leave rap music caught in its crosshairs.26
This Article thus uses rap music as a vehicle for analyzing these problems
because, like the true threats doctrine itself, rap music is complex, constituting “an
urban, often urbane, melange of politics, rock ‘n roll, rhythm and blues, African
vocal traditions, and modern technology.”27 In addition, because rap often features
a political component—speech at the heart of First Amendment protection28—it
exacerbates problems in deciphering what constitutes a true threat. Moreover, rap

frequently embraces hyperbole,29 and the Supreme Court made it clear forty-five
years ago that political hyperbole, standing alone, does not amount to a true
threat.30 Furthermore, although some forms of rap music may contain violently
themed lyrics, the Supreme Court was unequivocal in Brown v. Entertainment
Merchants Ass’n that there is no exception to First Amendment protection for
violence-based entertainment content.31
All of these complexities are arguably compounded because, as Jason Powell
notes, rap is “not an area of expertise for the average judiciary. In spite of the fact
that hip-hop is now a well-recognized and accepted genus of music, it is mostly a
foreign language to courts, and is treated accordingly.”32
This is particularly troubling in true threats cases because the central factual
question in them is “the meaning that is properly assigned to a speaker’s
communication. The assignment of meaning is typically bound up with its cultural
context, which frequently extends far beyond the speaker’s literal words.”33 As
indicated by the oral argument before the Supreme Court in Air Wisconsin Airlines
Corp. v. Hoeper, sorting out the meaning of words is never easy.34 Ultimately,
then, “[s]eparating graphic language and emotional exaggeration from genuine
threats is an old First Amendment problem.”35
The issues, then, that this Article tackles are the problems in determining
whether or not any particular instance of rap music constitutes a true threat of
violence. These are very different questions from another important issue—one
already addressed elsewhere—of whether rap lyrics may be admitted as evidence to
prove the commission of another crime36 or when rap music or rappers allegedly

incite violence.37
Part I of this Article provides a primer on the true threats doctrine, including
both its uncertainties and unsettled aspects, as well as its ostensible distinction from
another category of unprotected expression that might be considered its close legal
cousin—incitement to violence. Moving in interdisciplinary fashion to literature
from outside the law, Part II sets forth an overview of the historical, political,
cultural and racial aspects of rap music that may, perhaps subtly and even
imperceptibly, initially tilt the scales of justice against defendants charged with
making true threats in the form of rap lyrics. Part III then bridges true threats and
rap music, as it uses hypothetical situations to explore and analyze problems with
the true threats doctrine. Finally, the Article concludes in Part IV by offering
several suggestions for how the Supreme Court could help to clarify these doctrinal
issues, particularly as they affect rap.
I. THE TRUE THREATS DOCTRINE: REALITIES, UNCERTAINTIES
AND CIRCUIT SPLITS
This Part has two sections. Initially, Section A provides an overview of the true
threats doctrine, including the Supreme Court’s development of the doctrine
through two major cases. Section B then highlights the current splits of authority
among lower courts regarding what precisely a true threat entails, as well the
problem that arises in distinguishing between true threats and incitement to
unlawful conduct.
A. SUPREME COURT RULINGS FROM WATTS THROUGH BLACK
Among the few so-called “categorical carve-outs” of expression that are not
protected by the First Amendment is the niche known as true threats.38 Indeed, as
one federal appellate court recently observed, “[t]hreats generally are not entitled to
First Amendment protection.”39 True threats are not safeguarded by the
Constitution because, as a matter of public policy, it is desirable:
(1) to protect people from the fear of violence; (2) to prevent the disruption that this
fear engenders; (3) to incarcerate people who have identified themselves as likely to
carry out a threatened crime before they have the opportunity to perpetrate the crime;
and (4) to prevent people from being coerced into acting against their will.40

New Jersey found that in 18 cases in which various courts considered the admissibility of rap as
evidence, the lyrics were allowed nearly 80 percent of the time”).

Thus, all state and federal statutes that purport to regulate threats must be measured
against and comply with the Supreme Court’s true threats jurisprudence.41 As one
federal appellate court wrote in 2013, the nation’s high court “taught us to interpret
threat statutes in light of the First Amendment.”42
The Supreme Court ruled forty-five years ago in Watts v. United States that “a
threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.”43 The
case pivoted on eighteen-year-old Robert Watts’ statement during a rally on the
Washington Monument grounds in August 1966: “If they ever make me carry a
rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J.”44 Watts was convicted,
based on this statement, of threatening President Lyndon Baines Johnson under a
federal statute.45 The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Watts’ “only
offense here was ‘a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political
opposition to the President.’”46
Watts has been criticized by many First Amendment scholars, including
Professor Frederick Schauer, who asserts that the case “provides virtually no
information on just what a threat is other than that what Watts said was not one.”47
Although the Watts Court, indeed, failed to provide a concise definition of true
threats,48 the case made it clear that “political hyperbole” of the kind used by
Robert Watts does not rise to the level of a true threat—especially when the words,
which must be “[t]aken in context,” are “expressly conditional” upon future events
transpiring, and when the reaction of the audience is taken into account.49 Watts
thus “lays the foundation on which the Court builds its understanding of how to
distinguish protected speech or expressive conduct from unprotected threats.”50
Specifically, “content and context . . . were central to the Court’s analysis.”51
Other courts today agree that content and context are key factors in sorting out true
threats from protected expression.52 Along with the audience’s reaction, the

variables of content and context thus are sometimes described as “the three Watts
factors.”53
After Watts, the Court largely “has left the development of true threat analysis to
the circuit and state courts.”54 Indeed, as Professor Mark Strasser observed in
2011, the Court has provided “little guidance with respect to what constitutes a
threat that is outside First Amendment protection. State and lower federal courts
have been trying to make sense of this area of the law, sometimes seeking to refine
what the Court has said and sometimes striking out on their own.”55 Professor
Lauren Gilbert concurs, writing that:
[T]he Supreme Court’s failure to articulate a clear standard in that case or subsequent
cases for what constitutes a true threat has contributed to the doctrinal confusion that
has persisted for more than thirty years. Subsequent criminal cases in the various
circuits involving threats to the President and other government officials have
departed from Watts, often upholding jury verdicts of guilty despite evidence that the
statements were not intended as threats.56

Indeed, this lack of high court leadership is one of the major problems with the
refinement of the true threats doctrine.
Perhaps the Supreme Court’s most significant post-Watts effort to refine the true
threats doctrine came in its 2003 opinion in Virginia v. Black.57 In that case, the
Court considered the constitutionality of a state statute that banned cross burning
done with an intent to intimidate.58 Writing a key portion of the Court’s opinion in
which four other justices joined, Justice O’Connor opined that true threats
“encompass those statements where the speaker means to communicate a serious
expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular
individual or group of individuals.”59 She elaborated that a “speaker need not
actually intend to carry out the threat” in order for the speech to fall outside of the
scope of First Amendment protection.60 O’Connor added that “[i]ntimidation in the
constitutionally proscribable sense of the word is a type of true threat, where a
speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing
the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.”61

a true threat can be determined only by looking at the challenged statement in context. . . . Given both
the content and the context of the statement at issue here, we conclude that it is not a constitutionally
proscribable true threat.” (emphasis added)).

B. THE POST-BLACK PROBLEMS WITH TRUE THREATS
Black, unfortunately, did not resolve the issue of what constitutes a true threat.
There is a circuit split on the question of intent in the aftermath of Virginia v.
Black, specifically on the difference between objective intent and subjective
intent.62
In other words, does it matter under the true threats doctrine what the speakerdefendant actually (subjectively) intended the message to mean or, conversely, does
it only matter that the speaker-defendant intended to transmit the message and that
the interpretation or meaning of the message is measured by some objective,
reasonable-person approach? A subjective intent test “would require specific intent
by the speaker as to the audience’s interpretation.”63 Under an objective test, the
question generally is whether “a reasonable person would perceive the threat as
real.”64
Does Black, then, require “that a defendant subjectively intend to threaten,”65 as
the defendant in United States v. Elonis asserted? In that case, the defendant
argued that Black’s “definition of true threats means that the speaker must both
intend to communicate and intend for the language to threaten the victim.”66 Or
does Black only require, under an objective standard, consideration of “whether a
reasonable observer would perceive the threat as real”?67 Put slightly differently,
does Black require that “a reasonable recipient would have interpreted the
defendant’s communication as a serious threat to injure”?68 This “reasonableperson” standard:
[W]innows out protected speech because, instead of ignoring context, it forces jurors
to examine the circumstances in which a statement is made: A juror cannot
permissibly ignore contextual cues in deciding whether a “reasonable person” would
perceive the charged conduct “as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily
harm.”69

And among courts that have adopted an objective intent requirement, there is
even a disagreement as to precisely which perspective should be taken when
viewing the message. Should it be that of a reasonable sender, a reasonable
recipient/hearer or simply an objectively reasonable person?70 In the Second
Circuit, for instance, the test is “whether an ordinary, reasonable recipient who is

familiar with the context of the [communication] would interpret it as a threat of
injury.”71 While the vast majority of federal appellate courts have held that the true
threats doctrine merely requires some form of an objective intent standard,72 the
Ninth Circuit has, post-Black, “analyzed speech under both an objective and a
subjective standard.”73 As the Ninth Circuit recently opined, “in order to be subject
to criminal liability for a threat, the speaker must subjectively intend to threaten.”74
In the Ninth Circuit, after Black, it is “not sufficient that objective observers would
reasonably perceive such speech as a threat of injury or death.”75 Instead, as the
Ninth Circuit reasoned:
Because the true threat requirement is imposed by the Constitution, the subjective test
set forth in Black must be read into all threat statutes that criminalize pure speech.
The difference is that with respect to some threat statutes, we require that the
purported threat meet an objective standard in addition, and for some we do not.76

Importantly, the Ninth Circuit is not alone in subscribing to the belief that a
subjective intent on the part of the speaker is a requirement of the true threat
doctrine. The highest appellate courts in at least three states—Massachusetts,77
Rhode Island78 and Vermont79—fall in line with the Ninth Circuit’s view.
Furthermore, there is even a state-versus-federal split of authority in some
regions of the country, under which the highest appellate state court requires one

standard of intent, while the federal appellate circuit that geographically covers that
same state requires a different standard of intent. For instance, in 2011 the
Supreme Court of California openly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s conclusion
that subjective intent must exist for a statement to constitute a true threat.80
Similarly, in another post-Black decision, the Supreme Court of Washington wrote
that, “We have adopted an objective standard for determining what constitutes a
true threat.”81 Both California and Washington fall within the geographic confines
of the Ninth Circuit.82
While arguments against imposing a subjective intent requirement hinge on the
additional barriers to successful prosecution it might pose, a 2013 article in the
Harvard Law Review asserts that:
The means of demonstrating subjective intent, chiefly through circumstantial
evidence, closely track the mens rea element required in most criminal statutes, and
such evidence is likely to overlap significantly with the kind submitted under an
objective standard. Prosecutors are experienced in proving states of mind, and the
subjective standard would require only that threat statutes incorporate a mental state
analysis akin to those required of criminal prosecutions.83

Beyond the question of intent, another major problem today is the possible
conflation of—or confusing overlap between—the true threats doctrine and the
Supreme Court’s incitement jurisprudence under Brandenburg v. Ohio.84 In
Brandenburg, which was decided the same year as Watts and which “brought into
power the modern-day incitement test,”85 the Court held that:
[T]he constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to
forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to
incite or produce such action.86

Professor Susan Gilles recently wrote that this three-part test, which requires
intent to incite, a likelihood of inciting and the temporal imminence of incitement,

is “remarkably protective of speech.”87 Unlike the ambiguity regarding whether or
not the true threats doctrine requires a subjective intent, Brandenburg entails a
“requirement to prove subjective intent and not just tendency.”88 It thus would
seem odd that while a subjective intent for others to cause violence clearly is
required under incitement jurisprudence,89 no such subjective intent is required
under the true threats doctrine.
The doctrinal confusion stems from the fact that a true threat may be considered
to be a “type of violence advocacy,”90 and some argue that courts should “broaden
the true threat standard to allow for penalizing or regulating incitement.”91 As
Professor Strasser recently wrote:
[T]he Court has employed true threat jurisprudence in a way that practically extends
an invitation to lower courts to circumvent Brandenburg protections. Until the Court
addresses what to do when expression might reasonably be described both as
constituting incitement of illegal activity and as constituting an actual threat of serious
harm, the jurisprudence in this area will continue to be in disarray.92

Professor Strasser adds that the “Court has never faced the difficulties posed for
First Amendment jurisprudence by the possibility that particular expression might
reasonably be construed as (1) advocacy, (2) a true threat, or (3) both.”93 Strasser
contends that “the Court has pretended that there was only one characterization that
might reasonably be offered and then has analyzed whether the expression was
protected in light of the chosen characterization.”94 Ultimately, as another article
notes, “the line between ‘threat’ cases under Watts and ‘incitement’ cases under
Brandenburg is somewhat blurred.”95
Part of the problem relates to who, under the true threats doctrine, should be
considered as possible perpetrators that ostensibly will commit the underlying
violence. Can a true threat exist when the threatened violence will occur not at the
hands of the communicator/speaker, but will be carried out by someone either
referenced in the communicator’s message or who might simply read it and commit
the act? In other words, to constitute a true threat, must the person who

communicates the alleged threat be the same person who will also purportedly
carry it out—what might be called a first-person, threat-of-violence scenario—or
can the person who will carry it out be someone else—a third-person, threat-ofviolence scenario? Is the latter scenario—the third-person, threat-of-violence
situation—more akin to an incitement scenario than a true threat?
This issue recently arose in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In her
June 2013 dissent in United States v. Turner, Circuit Judge Rosemary Pooler wrote
that “in determining whether speech is a purported threat, we must make sure that
the speech is not instead advocacy protected by Brandenburg.”96 She reasoned that
the true threats doctrine requires that the message recipient be fearful of the
execution of the threat by the speaker, while the incitement/advocacy doctrine
under Brandenburg entails the exhortation of others to commit violence.97 The
problem, Pooler observed, is that “[s]peech may be ambiguous as to who will cause
injury and still constitute a threat.”98 A single statement, she wrote, could be both a
true threat and an incitement because “[s]peech may threaten violence that the
speaker controls and exhort others to act, directing the speech to both the victim
and third parties.”99 In Turner, Judge Pooler concluded that the defendant’s
“communications were advocacy and not a threat,” and thus she dissented from the
majority, which found the messages were a threat.100
The two-judge majority in Turner, however, seemed unfazed by the distinction
between who might carry out the violence—the speaker or a third party—in
determining that the defendant’s communications were true threats.101 The
majority, in rejecting Judge Pooler’s view and that of the defendant, opined that:
This argument . . . relies overmuch on the literal denotation and syntax of Turner’s
statements, refusing to acknowledge that threats—which may be prohibited,
consistent with the First Amendment—need be neither explicit nor conveyed with the
grammatical precision of an Oxford don. Turner’s conduct was reasonably found by
the jury to constitute a threat, unprotected by the First Amendment; it need not also
constitute incitement to imminent lawless action to be properly proscribed.102

In summary, true threats jurisprudence today is plagued by splits of authority
and ambiguity. It is into this haziness that rap music sometimes falls when lyrics
allude to or directly reference violence. But rap itself is an exceedingly complex
genre, and the next Part illustrates this by providing context for meaning and
understanding that courts and jurors, ideally, should consider when sorting out
whether a specific instance of rap music constitutes an unprotected threat.103

That was part of a Facebook post authored by Anthony Elonis and “styled as a
rap song” about a visit he received from two FBI agents investigating previous
violence-themed posts.105 Another piece of the same post, which also was penned
in rap format, comprised the basis of Count Five of a criminal indictment against
Elonis106 for violating a federal statute prohibiting threats of violence.107 A jury
convicted him on Count Five, and in September 2013, the Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit affirmed that decision.108 In his February 2014 petition for a writ of
certiorari, Elonis asserted that the Facebook posts leading to his arrest were merely
fictitious and therapeutic raps, sometimes modeled on those of Eminem.109
Does or should it matter that Elonis’ posts ostensibly took the form of rap lyrics?
It arguably should matter considerably because, as noted earlier, context is a key

question constitutes a true threat or whether it is protected political expression. United States v. Davila,

factor in determining whether speech constitutes a true threat under Watts.110 This
Part thus explores, in interdisciplinary fashion, the contextual factors and elements
that often comprise rap music. These factors might help jurors to better understand
and decode whether any given message that purports to be First Amendmentshielded rap music rises to the level of an unprotected threat.
For instance, Anthony Elonis proclaims in the lyrics quoted above that he is
“just a crazy sociopath that gets off playin’ you stupid fucks.”111 Should a
reasonable person take it seriously that Elonis is a crazy sociopath? Probably not.
Charis Kubrin, an associate professor of criminology, law and society at the
University of CaliforniaíIrvine, explains that rappers often use lyrics to build
identities and reputations—or simply “reps,” in the parlance of rap.112 “At the top
of the hierarchy is the ‘crazy’ or ‘wild’ social identity,” Kubrin writes.113 She
elucidates:
As a way to display a certain predisposition to violence, rappers often characterize
themselves and others as “mentally unstable” and therefore extremely dangerous.
Consider Snoop Dogg and DMX, both of whom had murder charges brought against
them in the 1990s: “Here’s a little something about a nigga like me / I never should
have been let out the penitentiary / Snoop Dogg would like to say / That I’m a crazy
motherfucker when I’m playing with my AK [AK-47 assault rifle].”114

In other words, a reasonable person who understands the nature of rap music
arguably would suspect, if not outright know, that Elonis was merely posing to
develop what Kubrin refers to as “the ‘crazy’ persona.”115 Indeed, much of rap is
about projecting images—not necessarily realities—of rappers “as assassins,
hustlers, gangstas, madmen, mercenary soldiers, killas, thugs, and outlaws.”116 A
2005 law journal article adds that rap artists often claim “that their ‘rap persona’ is
merely a fictional identity built from a hyperbolic extension of their own personal
emotions and experiences. In essence, they claim to be role playing.”117 Another
article wryly notes that “in many instances the posturing of rappers amounts simply
to marketing ploys designed to provide a safe fantasy for suburbanites.”118
Jurors need to understand such distinctions between fictional images and realworld realities when sorting out what really is a true threat of violence. As the
Supreme Court intimated in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, when striking down
a federal statute banning fictional images of child pornography, there is a clear

difference between protected fantasy and unprotected reality.119
With the Elonis sociopath example in mind, Section A immediately below
provides a brief primer on the nomenclature of rap, while Section B that follows
sets forth an overview of the many elements and variables that comprise rap music.
A. UNPACKING THE TERMINOLOGY: HIP HOP, RAP & GANGSTA RAP
Rap music “is the verbal and musical domain of hip-hop, an expressive oral
form through which personal and social perspectives are amplified.”120 As an early
scholarly article on the topic explains, rap music, which dates back to the late
1970s,121 “comes from the youth subculture known as hip hop, a movement that
also encompasses breakdancing and more recent dances, graffiti art, fashion, and
figures of speech.”122 Rap thus is merely one component or facet of the larger
culture of hip hop,123 which also encompasses “a style of dress, dialect and
language, [a] way of looking at the world, and an aesthetic that reflects the
sensibilities of a large population of youth born between 1965 and 1984.”124 Hip
hop today is “a United States phenomenon and a global cultural and entertainment
movement.”125 And while it started in the South Bronx in the early 1970s, now
“mainstream hip-hop has evolved into a largely commercial enterprise targeting a
young and white buying audience.”126
Although rap today earns “increasing social acceptance and cultural
legitimization,” it is firmly rooted in cultural controversy.127 Like jazz and rock
before it, rap “has been critically reviewed as a corrosive influence on young and
impressionable listeners.”128 Thus, when any example of rap music today is
brought into the legal system because it allegedly is a threat, both it and its author
arguably face an uphill battle and start with a negative bias against them because

RAP MUSIC AND THE TRUE THREATS QUAGMIRE

rap, as a genre, carries with it the heavy baggage of negative controversy. Indeed,
the mainstream press has frequently connected both violence and crime to rap.129
Adding to that stigmatizing load is the fact that criminality has “become
sedimented in the popular lexicon as the key or trademark term for the subgenre” of
rap known as gangsta rap.130
The general category of rap music, in fact, has several subgenres, only one of
which is gangsta rap.131 Sparked by the 1988 N.W.A. songs “Gangsta Gangsta”
and “Fuck the Police,” gangsta rap prominently emerged in the late 1980s and early
1990s.132 During this time, gangsta rap gained “notoriety, in part, due to its
misogynous themes, encouragement of hypermaterialism, violent lyrics, and the
behavior of some of its artists.”133 Its roots are “traced to early depictions of the
hustler lifestyle and blaxploitation movies of the 1970s, which glorified blacks as
criminals, pimps, pushers, prostitutes, and gangsters.”134 Some attribute the
increased focus on the kind of violently explicit lyrics that pervade gangsta rap to
the commercial forces of big record labels.135 That is, certain elements within
gangsta rap “have come to spread and define rap music as a whole” due to the
commercial success of the subgenre. 136
In summary, gangsta rap is a negatively stigmatized subgenre of a larger
category of music called rap. Rap, in turn, is only one aspect of a much bigger
cultural movement and lifestyle known as hip-hop.137

multifaceted and intricate nature of the meaning of rap music and, in turn, why it is
exceedingly difficult to sort out whether any specific instance of it constitutes a true
threat.138 Specifically, Shusterman asserts that examining rap lyrics “will reveal in
many rap songs not only the cleverly potent vernacular expression of keen insights
but also forms of linguistic subtlety and multiple levels of meaning whose
polysemic complexity, ambiguity, and intertextuality can sometimes rival that of
high art’s so-called ‘open work.’”139 Adding to the problem of deciphering
meaning is the reality, as Professor Kubrin notes, that “listeners interpret music in
multiple ways” and “rap and its lyrics are appropriated and embedded into specific
individual, familial, and community fields of reference.”140
Rap music is freighted with multiple components of American life. As
Professor Forman notes, “Rap and hip-hop are . . . inextricably entwined with race,
cultural politics, ideology, and communication in contemporary America.”141
Among its many facets, rap music sometimes is political. A 1991 article in
Black Music Research Journal contends that rap may, in fact, “be the most political
medium in the country.”142 Indeed, rap’s origins are inextricably tied to politics,
with the first political rap song arguably being 1982’s “The Message” by
Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.143 A recent article explains that “[r]ap
originated in the late 1970s in the South Bronx during a time marked by extreme
political conservatism and economic downfall” and that it:
[Q]uickly became one of the premier forms of expression for the youngest members
of the inner city black and Latino communities in New York, which were the hardest
hit by the conservative politics and the economic decline during said epoch. Rap then,
irrespective of its particular subject matter and stated purpose during its initial stages,
must be viewed as an important socio-political innovation. 144

While “The Message” may have been the first political rap song, a recent article
in Journal of Black Studies explains that “[i]n 1988, two albums in particular—
Public Enemy’s ‘It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back’ and NWA’s
‘Straight Outta Compton’—marked an important shift whereby rap became a
vehicle for political discourse. Both albums fearlessly attacked law enforcement in
particular.”145 A 1993 scholarly article elaborates that:
[H]ard-core rappers detail the unemployment, mis-education, discrimination,
homicides, gang life, class oppression, police brutality and regressive gender politics
that dominate the lives of many black youth. The macho boasting, misogyny, violent
fantasies and false consciousness exist side by side with an immature, but clear,

critique of authority, a loathing of the oppressive character of wage labour, a hatred of
racism and an exposé of Reaganism.146

And while gangsta rap often is the target of criticism, its artists claim “they are
simply expressing a social perspective on reality among the urban under-classes,
occupying a role as ‘ghetto street reporters’ or constructing fictional narratives that
relate to actual conditions in America’s larger cities.”147
In addition to political commentary, violence is a popular theme in rap music
and, in particular, gangsta rap. Indeed, “rap music has appropriated homicide as a
central theme in lyrical compositions.”148 One study published in 2009 found that
“the emergence of gangster rap is very strongly associated with increases in violent
lyrical content.”149 For instance, Professor Jeffrey Ogbar notes that between 1992
and 2006, “only two adult solo male rappers . . . ha[d] gone platinum without
killing ‘niggas,’ referencing bitches, hos, and nihilistic violence on an album.”150
Blending with the violence, then, is politics, as Professor Ogbar asserts that
“explicit political commentaries are made by commercial rappers that address war,
poverty, and police brutality in very sophisticated and highly racialized
discourses.”151 Public Enemy, for instance, offered “biting criticism of prisons,
white supremacy, political corruption, and police brutality.”152
Rap is also a form of art, poetry and fantasy. In fact, “gangsta rap operates
within a well-documented poetic tradition within African American culture that
ritualizes invective, satire, obscenity and other verbal phenomena with
transgressive aims.”153 Its linguistic violence involves “performance, play and
perhaps even social messages all at the same time.”154 The violent imagery, in part,
sometimes embraces the fantasy of violent revolt.155 The hyper-materialism
(driving Lexuses and drinking Cristal, for example), in turn, reflects “the gaudy
fantasy world of some rappers.”156 Professor Kubrin explains in a 2006 article that:
For some scholars, rappers represent black poets of the contemporary urban scene . . .
who use music as a vehicle for telling the history of African American culture . . . .

For others, rap music serves as an expressive artistic outlet for a marginalized urban
social bloc . . . a contemporary response to joblessness, poverty, and disempowerment . . . , and an art form that reflects the nuances, pathology, and most
importantly, the resilience of America’s black ghettos.157

Finally, rap music also often is equated with black America and thus it is not
only political in nature, but also racialized as “a product of black culture.”158 A
study published in 2013 observes “[a]ll that was right and wrong with rap was read
as a reflection of black America. Positioned in the press as a black musical form
that sprang from black inner-city neighborhoods, the violence associated with rap
was de facto black violence.”159 The same study notes that because it often was
“[c]onnected to drugs, gangs, and the glorification of sexual domination through
lyrics, the real life experiences of rappers, or audiences’ imaginations, public
definitions of the artistic value of rap and its political message were also filtered
through the music’s racial identification.”160 Ultimately, as one article explains,
“[t]here is little doubt that rap serves as a key contributing factor in the social
construction of African-American culture.”161 In fact, “[f]rom the start, the public
viewed hip-hop culture and rap music through a racist lens.”162
In summary, then, rap is a complex genre. Its very nature compounds the
difficulties with the already muddled true threats doctrine described in Part I when
a specimen of rap is accused of being a true threat. It is not hard to speculate that
the legal deck may be stacked decidedly against rap music, replete with its negative
stereotypes of violence and nihilism,163 when its authors are accused of embedding
threats in lyrics. Indeed, although much of it may now be commercialized and
mainstreamed164 as part of the “mass commodification of rap music,”165 rap long
has existed “as a form of oppositional culture.”166 And when it is brought into
court as an alleged true threat, it supposedly stands in opposition to the First
Amendment. As Professors Erik Nielson and Charis Kubrin wrote in January
2014, rap today is “as vulnerable as ever to judicial abuse.”167

With Nielson and Kubrin’s timely warning in mind, the next Part of this Article
bridges problems with the true threats doctrine and the negative stereotypes and
multiple meanings of rap music. Using hypothetical examples, Part III illustrates
that if context really is a key factor in sorting out what constitutes a true threat, then
jurors must be instructed to take into account the contextual variables that surround
rap.
III. ANALYZING RAPS AS THREATS: SOME LESSONS ABOUT
VANTAGE POINTS THROUGH THE RAP LENS
This Part illustrates the gravity of the problems with today’s true threats doctrine
described in Part I through the lens of rap music reviewed in Part II. In the process,
this Part provides hypothetical examples that demonstrate how radically different
legal conclusions might be reached, depending on the judicial approach adopted for
true threats and the evidence, including expert testimony, courts admit to help
jurors understand rap-message meaning.
Before going further, it is important to recall that, regardless of whether courts
employ an objective or subjective intent approach, circumstantial evidence likely
will be used by jurors to determine intent.168 Just as circumstantial evidence is
relevant to proving the subjective state of mind requirement of actual malice in
defamation law,169 so too is it relevant in proving the subjective state of mind of
intent in true threats cases. Furthermore, part of that circumstantial-evidence
evaluation in true threats cases involves considering “the totality of the
circumstances and not just the words in isolation.”170 In brief, circumstantial
evidence related to rap music may be admitted to provide context—a key factor
dating back to Watts171—for interpreting the meaning of rap-formatted messages.
Finally, it is clear that other contextual factors—ones beyond rap music itself—
should be considered by jurors in true threats cases involving rap messages. For
instance, if the rap takes the form of a video posted on YouTube, jurors might
consider and evaluate whether the medium of YouTube itself is one on which rap
messages should be taken seriously as threats or whether the raps represent public
posturing. Video images arguably can supplement, complement, enhance or even
contradict the meaning of the written or spoken words of a rap. Similarly, if the rap
is publicly posted in the form of written lyrics on Facebook, should this social
media context make a difference? An extended discussion of such issues is beyond
the scope of this Article, which focuses solely on the contextual variable of rap
itself, not the medium through which it is conveyed.

A. ON OBJECTIVE APPROACH TO THREATS: WHAT DOES “REASONABLENESS”
MEAN IN INTERPRETING RAP LYRICS?
If, as the majority of jurisdictions currently do,172 a court embraces an objective
test that pivots on hypothetically “reasonable” interpretations of messages written
in the form of raps, then the threshold question relates to vantage point.
Specifically, the issue is whether the rap message should be interpreted from the
perspective or vantage point of: (1) a reasonable recipient of the message (or a
reasonable person in the position of the recipient or a reasonable person in the
position of the target-victim); (2) a reasonable sender of the message (or a
reasonable person in the position of the defendant who sent or otherwise
communicated the message) or, even more speculatively and amorphously, (3) a
reasonable person.
Courts adopting an objective test disagree on the proper approach for sorting out
meaning, as a quick review of very recent cases illustrates. For instance, in 2013
the First Circuit wrote in United States v. Clemens that it has adopted the second
option, namely “an objective defendant vantage point standard post-Black.”173 A
Connecticut appellate court elaborated, in also adopting this standard, that the test
is whether a “reasonable speaker” would foresee that the actual recipient, under the
circumstances in question, would “believe that [the recipient] will be subjected to
physical violence upon his person.” 174
In contrast, in 2012 the Sixth Circuit opined in United States v. Jeffries that the
focus must be “the effect on a reasonable listener of the speech.”175 Still different,
in 2013 the Eleventh Circuit held in United States v. Martinez that, in general, “[a]
true threat is determined from the position of an objective, reasonable person.” 176
In 2004, the Fifth Circuit also embraced this more general standard, writing that
“[s]peech is a ‘true threat’ and therefore unprotected if an objectively reasonable
person would interpret the speech as a ‘serious expression of an intent to cause a
present or future harm.’”177
While the Ninth Circuit has held that, after Black, a subjective intent test must
be read into all speech-based threat statutes, the Ninth Circuit also holds that some
threats statutes must be analyzed under both a subjective and objective approach.178
Under its objective approach, the issue becomes how a reasonable person in the
position of the recipient would interpret the message.179
The next critical question becomes, under any of these three objective standards:
What should courts and jurors expect a reasonable person to know and understand
about rap music? The answer likely varies depending upon the facts of the case,

with the actual knowledge of (and background with) rap music of both the
defendant and the alleged victim possibly playing significant roles. It is clear,
however, that a reasonable person standard “forces jurors to examine the
circumstances in which a statement is made” and, under it, “[a] juror cannot
permissibly ignore contextual cues.” 180
Imagine, for instance, that the target or victim of a rap-based message is a police
officer who works on a gang task force and, due to his knowledge, training and
experience, is acutely familiar with rap, including the posturing and personas that
rappers often take on, as well as rap’s frequent violent and political, anti-police
themes. This officer thus might be referred to, for shorthand purposes, as the “rapliterate target.”
This contextual background seems very relevant under an objective-recipient
standard. To provide breathing room for the First Amendment interest in free
speech, jurors should be asked to consider whether a reasonable police officer, one
who is familiar with rap music, would take the message as a threat. And what if the
police officer specifically knew that the speaker-defendant was a rapper before the
officer received the threat? The jury, then, should be required to consider whether
a reasonable police officer, who is familiar with rap music and who is familiar with
the speaker-defendant’s rapping background, would interpret the message as a true
threat.
In such a scenario, the meaning of a hypothetical rap directed at an officer and
posted on YouTube with the seemingly straight-forward lyrics “I know you, you
know me / gonna kill this cop, let’s all be free” becomes much more complex. Is it
artistic and political hyperbole—the stereotypical, anti-cop rhetoric and rant
engaged in by a rapper, perhaps trying to maintain his street credibility if the officer
in question had previously arrested him? Would a reasonable police officer in the
position of this one therefore feel less threatened or more threatened?
Furthermore, a speaker-defendant who has a demonstrated or proven
background either as a rapper or as a serious fan of rap music should, in the First
Amendment interest of protecting his speech rights, have these aspects of his
background admitted as evidence. As the Seventh Circuit wrote in 2008 in
considering a true threats case, “[c]ontextual information—especially aspects of a
defendant’s background that have a bearing on whether his statements might
reasonably be interpreted as a threat—is relevant and potentially admissible
regardless of whether the recipient or targeted victim had full access to that
information.”181
What if, in contrast to the police officer (the rap-literate target) hypothetical
addressed above, the target or alleged victim of the defendant’s rap message has no
background whatsoever in rap music and its conventions? This person can be
dubbed the “rap-ignorant target.”
A crucial question for this scenario is whether this rap-ignorant target is even a
“reasonable” person or whether the law today, given the vast popularity of hip
180.

hop,182 should assume that a reasonable person of a certain age—surely someone
from the so-called “hip hop generation”183—would have at least some minimal
background with rap.
This rap-ignorant target thus illustrates yet another fundamental problem with
the current true threats doctrine—namely, the assumptions (more cynically put, the
guesses) that jurors must make about the kind of baseline or foundational
knowledge and background about particular genres of music and writing that
people (in particular, the targets of supposed threats) possess. Just as courts today
in defamation cases regarding reputational harm assume that reasonable readers
will be able to recognize satire by its literary conventions,184 so too should they
assume that reasonable people will be able to recognize rap and factor that in when
deciding whether or how such context affects message meaning.
This is not, of course, to say that simply because a message takes the form of a
rap that it never constitutes a true threat or that writers of raps are immunized from
criminal threats prosecution. As the Sixth Circuit wrote in 2012 in a threats case
involving a defendant who posted a YouTube video of himself singing a song that
was “part country, part rap,” a person cannot dodge a threats prosecution “merely
by delivering the threat in verse or by dressing it up with political (and protected)
attacks on the legal system.”185 Elaborating on this point, the Sixth Circuit
explained, with an aged but apt pop cultural reference, that:
Had Bob Dylan ended “Hurricane” with a threat to kill the judge who oversaw Rubin
Carter’s trial, the song’s other lyrics or the music that accompanied them would not
by themselves have precluded a prosecution. In the same way, [defendant] Jeffries
cannot insulate his menacing speech from proscription by conveying it in a music
video or for that matter by performing the song with a United States flag burning in
the background.186

What is important, at least from the perspective of safeguarding First
Amendment interests and erring on the side of free speech, is that courts: (1) take
into account the actual knowledge and background with rap music when the target
or victim is a rap-literate target and (2) attribute some minimal understanding of
rap’s conventions—the understanding that a hypothetical reasonable person would
have—to the rap-ignorant target.

But even that does not end the troubles with the vantage point issue in the true
threats doctrine. What happens if the target of the rap message is a person who,
although not quite completely ignorant of rap music, accepts as realities the
negative, violent and racist stereotypes associated with gangsta rap that he has read
about in the news media?187 Such a target might take the rap message more
seriously as a threat if it comes from a black rapper. In brief, the racial stereotypes
associated with gangsta rap today could possibly lead to an incorrect interpretation
of the meaning of a rap message and the subsequent wrongful incarceration of its
speaker.
Yet another predicament exists when the objective approach used in a true
threats case focuses on the viewpoint taken by an objective sender-defendant and
whether or not he should have foreseen that the rap message would be taken as a
threat by the recipient.188 A sender-defendant who is a rapper might easily have a
skewed perspective about rap messages—one such that he would naturally, albeit
perhaps naively, believe that everyone else (like himself) understands rap music’s
conventions and would never take the words in a rap literally. In other words, there
could be a dangerous disconnect of interpretation and understanding between the
rap-literate defendant and the rap-ignorant target. A rap-literate defendant who was
unaware of his target’s ignorance of rap’s conventions thus could be held
criminally accountable for something he (wrongly) assumed the target would not
take seriously. From a pro-First Amendment perspective, this is a troubling result
that illustrates a flaw with the true threats doctrine. Indeed, a rap-literate defendant
could be held liable here because he negligently or accidentally misjudged the
perspective and view the recipient would take.
B. A SUBJECTIVE APPROACH TO INTENT
Under a subjective approach, a rapper-defendant is held criminally responsible
only if he actually (subjectively) intended the rap message in question to be
interpreted by its target as a threat of imminent bodily harm or death.189 This
standard ramps up the First Amendment protection for the speaker, as the
prosecution would need to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt—and most
likely through circumstantial evidence—the mindset of the rapper at the time he or
she communicated the message in question.
A subjective intent approach also eliminates the problem that exists for
miscommunication and misjudgment of meaning in the rap-literate defendant and
rap-ignorant target scenario. Furthermore, a subjective intent requirement ends the
current oddity under which the incitement-to-violence doctrine per Brandenburg v.
Ohio entails such an intent requirement,190 but the true threats doctrine, at least as it
now is interpreted by a majority of courts, does not.

IV. CONCLUSION
This Article, in Part I, examined and explained the multiple problems and
predicaments that plague the modern-day true threats doctrine. These difficulties
and troubles range from splits of authority over whether or not the subjective intent
of the defendant-sender is doctrinally relevant, to disagreements about the proper
vantage point that must be taken if an objective approach to meaning is deployed,
to the lack of clarity, in some instances, between the doctrines of true threats and
incitement to violence.
The Article furthermore explored, in Part II, the complicated and controversial
nature of rap music. Significantly, it addressed the political, violent, racial, artistic
and cultural context that surrounds the genre of rap and, more specifically, the
subgenre of gangsta rap. It also described how rappers often adopt artificial
personas and describe fantasy violence.
The muddled true threats doctrine and the music known as rap collide today at a
dangerous First Amendment intersection. The problems are not likely to go away
soon, with one February 2014 newspaper article noting that “YouTube is awash
with hundreds of hip-hop music videos—ranging from amateurish cellphone
recordings to slick, nearly professional-grade productions—featuring young men
representing various neighborhoods, brandishing guns and firing off challenges to
rivals.”191 Beyond YouTube, violence also seems to be a key element in the
growing commercialization of rap music that won’t soon disappear.
Given the negative, violent and race-based stereotypes that sometimes surround
rap music, jurors must be exposed to evidence regarding other aspects of the genre
to help prevent them from reaching a verdict tainted by misconceptions and, worse
yet, racism about an artistic medium. The Supreme Court now has the opportunity
to either accept or reject this point since it has granted the petition for a writ of
certiorari in the case of United States v. Elonis described earlier in this Article.192
Ultimately, neither Watts nor Black—the Supreme Court’s two leading truethreats opinions—addressed or otherwise involved a dispute centering on an
alleged threat that was cloaked in or woven into the format of a genre of artistic
expression. While that pair of cases made it plain that context matters, the Court
now needs to clarify how a non-traditional mode of artistic and political expression
affects the contextual analysis and, in turn, the assumptions that can be made about
people’s understanding (or lack thereof) of that context. The Court should also
address whether, in fact, the actual knowledge of the target or recipient with the
genre (as described earlier in this Article, a rap-literate target versus a rap-ignorant
target) should be considered, not simply what a reasonable target would
hypothetically and speculatively know.
Furthermore, the Court must adopt a test that, at minimum, considers the

perspective of a speaker-defendant who is familiar with the artistic genre in
question, even if the Court also and additionally requires that the perspective of a
reasonable recipient or a reasonable target be considered. To only consider the
perspective of a reasonable recipient or target means that a speaker-defendant could
be criminally punished for something that is, quite literally, lost in translation.
