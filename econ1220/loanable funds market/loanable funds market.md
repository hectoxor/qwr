# The Market for Loanable Funds

## Introduction
Investment spending (spending on physical capital like factories and equipment) is a crucial component of GDP:
- It's typically the most volatile part of real GDP
- It contributes significantly to economic growth
- It requires funding, which usually comes from borrowing

The market for loanable funds explains how this borrowing happens by connecting savers (who supply funds) with borrowers (who demand funds).

## Key Terms and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Market for loanable funds** | A hypothetical market showing how loans from savers are allocated to borrowers with investment projects |
| **Savings-investment spending identity** | An equation showing investment spending equals savings (If there's $100,000 in investment, it must come from $100,000 in savings) |
| **Budget surplus** | When taxes collected exceed government spending |
| **Budget deficit** | When government spending exceeds taxes collected |
| **Budget balance** | When taxes collected equal government spending |
| **Public saving** | The difference between taxes and government spending (T-G); positive during surplus, negative during deficit |
| **Disposable income** | Income remaining after taxes (e.g., $100 income - $5 taxes = $95 disposable income) |
| **Private saving** | Disposable income minus consumption (e.g., $95 disposable income - $70 consumption = $25 private saving) |
| **National savings** | Total of private saving and public saving |
| **Closed economy** | An economy without international trade or movement of financial assets |
| **Open economy** | An economy with international trade and movement of financial assets |
| **Foreign funds** | Financial assets entering a country from abroad |
| **Domestic outflow of funds** | Financial assets leaving a country |
| **Capital inflows** | Net financial capital entering a country (foreign inflows minus domestic outflows) |
| **Rate of return** | Percentage gain on an investment (e.g., $100 cost generating $108 in sales = 8% return) |
| **Demand for loanable funds** | Shows willingness to borrow money; increases as interest rates decrease |
| **Supply of loanable funds** | Shows willingness to save money; increases as interest rates increase |

## National Savings

### Closed Economy
National Savings = Private Saving + Public Saving

### Open Economy
National Savings = Private Saving + Public Saving + Net Capital Inflows

### Example Calculation
The nation of Florin has:
- National income: $100 million
- Taxes: $10 million
- Consumption: $60 million
- Government spending: $8 million
- Net capital inflows: $4 million

National savings calculation:
```
National savings = Private savings + Public savings + Net Capital Inflows
                 = (Income - Taxes - Consumption) + (Taxes - Gov't spending) + NCI
                 = ($100M - $10M - $60M) + ($10M - $8M) + $4M
                 = $30M + $2M + $4M
                 = $36M
```

This means Florin has $36 million available to fund investment spending.

## The Loanable Funds Market

### Components
- **Quantity**: Amount of loans (loanable funds)
- **Price**: Real interest rate
- **Supply**: Represents savers (increases with higher interest rates)
- **Demand**: Represents borrowers (increases with lower interest rates)
- **Equilibrium**: Where quantity of savings equals quantity of loans demanded

## Changes in Demand for Loanable Funds

### Causes of Shifts in Demand
1. **Changes in anticipated rate of return on investment**
   - Higher expected returns → Higher demand for loans
   - Lower expected returns → Lower demand for loans

2. **Government policies**
   - Investment tax credits → Increase demand
   - Changes in business taxes → Affect demand

### Pro-cyclical Interest Rates
- When economy does well → Expected returns rise → Demand for loans increases → Interest rates rise
- When economy does poorly → Expected returns fall → Demand for loans decreases → Interest rates fall

## Changes in Supply of Loanable Funds

### Causes of Shifts in Supply
1. **Changes in saving behavior**
   - Higher preference for saving → Increased supply
   - Lower preference for saving → Decreased supply

2. **Changes in capital inflows**
   - More foreign investment → Increased supply
   - Less foreign investment → Decreased supply

3. **Changes in public savings**
   - Budget surpluses → Increased supply
   - Budget deficits → Decreased supply

## Government Budget Effects

### Two Perspectives on Budget Deficits

1. **Deficit increases demand for loanable funds**
   - Government must borrow to cover deficit
   - Government joins other borrowers in the market
   - Demand curve shifts right → Interest rates rise

2. **Deficit decreases supply of loanable funds**
   - National savings includes public savings (T-G)
   - Deficit means negative public savings
   - Supply curve shifts left → Interest rates rise

Both perspectives lead to the same outcome: **Deficits increase interest rates**

Similarly, budget surpluses decrease interest rates.

## The Fisher Effect

The Fisher effect states that changes in expected inflation affect nominal interest rates but not real interest rates.

### Formula
Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation rate

### Example
- Current situation:
  - Real interest rate: 5%
  - Inflation: 2%
  - Nominal interest rate: 7%

- If expected inflation decreases by 1%:
  - Real interest rate: 5% (unchanged)
  - Expected inflation: 1%
  - New nominal interest rate: 6%

## Key Equations

### Savings-Investment Identity
S = I

This identity derives from the national income equation:

1. Start with national income equation: Y = C + I + G + NX
2. For a closed economy (no international trade): Y = C + I + G
3. Rearranging to isolate I: Y - C - G = I
4. Breaking out taxes: (Y - T - C) + (T - G) = I
5. For an open economy, add net capital inflows: (Y - T - C) + (T - G) + NCI = I

Where:
- (Y - T - C) is private savings
- (T - G) is public savings
- NCI is net capital inflows

## Common Misperceptions

1. **Investment terminology**: In economics, "investment" refers to business spending on physical capital, not placing savings in financial instruments.

2. **Fisher effect**: Changes in expected inflation affect nominal interest rates, not real interest rates.

## Sample Problems

### Problem 1: Impact of Increased National Savings
An increase in national savings shifts the supply curve of loanable funds to the right. This results in:
- Lower equilibrium interest rate
- Higher quantity of loanable funds
- More investment projects funded

### Problem 2: Budget Changes After Negative Demand Shock
If an economy experiences a negative demand shock with automatic stabilizers:
- Tax revenues decrease (as income falls)
- Government spending increases (unemployment benefits, etc.)
- Budget moves into deficit
- Effect on loanable funds market: Either supply decreases or demand increases
- Result: Interest rates rise
