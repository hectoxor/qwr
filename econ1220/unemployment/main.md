# Unemployment Notes for AP Macroeconomics

## Key Measurements

### Unemployment Rate
- Formula: `UR = (# Unemployed ÷ Labor Force) × 100%`
- Measures percentage of labor force without jobs but actively seeking work
- **NOT** everyone without a job counts as unemployed

### Labor Force
- Formula: `LF = # Employed + # Unemployed`
- Includes people who are either:
  - Employed (worked at least 1 hour in reference week)
  - Unemployed (no work but actively job searching)

### Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)
- Formula: `LFPR = (Labor Force ÷ Eligible Population) × 100%`
- Eligible population = civilians 16+ who aren't institutionalized or in military
- Decreases when people leave labor force (retirement, discouraged workers)

## Types of Unemployment

### 1. Frictional Unemployment
- Occurs during normal job search process
- Example: Recent graduates looking for first job
- Part of natural rate of unemployment
- **Healthy** for economy (shows worker mobility)

### 2. Structural Unemployment
- Results from changes in economy's structure
- Examples: technological change, obsolete skills
- Part of natural rate of unemployment
- Can be long-term and challenging to resolve

### 3. Cyclical Unemployment
- Tied to business cycles (recessions/expansions)
- Increases during recessions, decreases during expansions
- Measures deviation from natural rate
- Target of most government policies

## Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)

- Sum of frictional + structural unemployment
- Exists even at full employment output
- Changes over time due to:
  - Demographic shifts
  - Labor market policies
  - Technological developments
  - Skill mismatches

## Limitations of Official Unemployment Rate

1. **Excludes discouraged workers** (want work but stopped looking)
2. **Ignores underemployment** (part-time workers who want full-time)
3. **Counts part-time as employed** (even if just 1 hour/week)
4. Doesn't measure quality of jobs

## Important Relationships

- Decreasing unemployment rate + decreasing LFPR = potential sign of discouraged workers
- Full employment ≠ zero unemployment
- Economy at production possibilities curve = at natural rate of unemployment
- Changes in unemployment rate alone don't tell complete story about labor market health

## Common Misperceptions

- Some unemployment is natural and healthy for economy
- Zero unemployment would mean zero job mobility
- Decreasing unemployment rate isn't always positive (could mean discouraged workers)
