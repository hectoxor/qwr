1. Factor Market Income Flow:
   Household provides labor → Gets wages
   Uses wages to buy goods → Goods Market

2. Goods Market Revenue Flow:
   Firm sells products → Gets revenue
   Uses revenue to buy factors → Factor Market
```

### Example of Full Cycle
```
Step 1 (Factor Market):
- Worker provides 8 hours labor to restaurant
- Restaurant pays $100 wages

Step 2 (Goods Market):
- Worker uses $100 to buy groceries
- Grocery store provides food items

Step 3 (Cycle Continues):
- Grocery store uses revenue to pay its workers
- Those workers buy more goods and services
```
