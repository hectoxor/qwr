# Tracking Inflation

## Methods of Measuring Inflation

### Common Price Indices
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Tracks a basket of consumer goods and services
- **Core Inflation Index**: CPI minus volatile items like food and energy
- **Producer Price Index (PPI)**: Measures prices paid by producers for inputs
- **GDP Deflator**: Includes ALL components of GDP 
- **International Price Index**: Based on imported/exported merchandise prices
- **Employment Cost Index**: Measures wage inflation in the labor market

## Major Biases in Inflation Measurement

### Substitution Bias
- **Definition**: Occurs when people substitute away from goods whose prices increase
- **Example**: If apple prices double, consumers might buy more oranges instead. A fixed basket calculation would overstate inflation by assuming people still buy the same amount of apples.
- **Real-world impact**: Overstates inflation by ~0.5% annually

### Quality/New Goods Bias
- **Definition**: Occurs when improvements in product quality or new products aren't accounted for
- **Examples**:
  - A laptop costs $1000 in 2020 and $1050 in 2022 (5% increase), but the 2022 model has double the memory and processing power
  - Smartphones weren't in CPI calculations until years after widespread adoption
- **Result**: Inflation appears higher than the true cost of living increase

## Practical Examples

1. **Hurricane Katrina (2005)**:
   - Gas prices jumped 40Â¢/gallon in one day
   - Appeared in CPI but not in core inflation index
   - Fed didn't adjust interest rates because this was temporary

2. **Technology Products**:
   - VCRs and personal computers were widely available in early 1980s
   - Not added to CPI basket until 1987
   - Cell phones had 40+ million subscribers before inclusion in CPI
   - Result: CPI missed years of price decreases after initial introduction
