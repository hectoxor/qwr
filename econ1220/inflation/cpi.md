# Consumer Price Index (CPI)

## Definition and Calculation
- **Definition**: Measure of inflation calculated using a fixed basket of goods and services representing average consumer purchases
- **Calculated by**: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
- **What it measures**: Change in prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services

## Core Inflation Index vs. Regular CPI

### Regular CPI
- Includes ALL Fconsumer goods and services
- **Purpose**: Helps households understand their overall cost of living month-to-month
- **Example**: If gas prices spike temporarily due to a hurricane, CPI will show this increase

### Core Inflation Index
- CPI excluding volatile items (typically food and energy)
- **Purpose**: Better measures underlying inflation trends for policy decisions
- **Example**: When drought causes temporary food price spikes, core inflation remains stable

## CPI Limitations and Biases

### Substitution Bias
- **Problem**: Fixed basket doesn't account for consumers switching to cheaper alternatives
- **Example**: If beef prices rise substantially, consumers might buy more chicken, but CPI assumes they still buy the same amount of beef
- **Result**: Overstates inflation

### Quality/New Goods Bias
- **Problem**: Improvements in existing products and introduction of new products aren't fully captured
- **Example**: A TV costs $500 in 2020 and $525 in 2023, but the newer model has better resolution, more features, and uses less electricity
- **Result**: Overstates inflation by treating the entire price increase as inflation rather than recognizing better quality

## Other Price Indices Compared to CPI

| Index | What It Measures | Example Use Case |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| CPI | Consumer goods & services prices | Adjusting Social Security payments |
| PPI | Prices paid by producers | Predicting future consumer price changes |
| GDP Deflator | Prices of all components in GDP | Measuring economy-wide inflation |
| Employment Cost Index | Wage inflation | Analyzing labor market trends |

## Modern Improvements in CPI Calculation
- More frequent updates to the basket of goods (captures new products faster)
- Advanced mathematical methods allowing for some substitution
- Quality adjustment studies for technology products
- Result: Reduced overstatement from roughly 1.1% to about 0.5% annually
