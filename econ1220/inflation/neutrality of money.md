# Neutrality of Money Explanation

## Short-Run vs Long-Run Neutrality

### Short-Run Neutrality
```markdown
• Changes in money supply temporarily affect real variables:
  - Output (Y)
  - Employment
  - Real interest rates
  
Example:
Before: M = $1000, P = $10, Y = 100 units
After money injection:
- Initially: More spending, Y increases
- Temporary boost to production and employment
```

### Long-Run Neutrality
```markdown
• Changes in money supply only affect nominal variables:
  - Price level
  - Nominal wages
  - Nominal exchange rates

Example from your notes:
Money doubles (100% increase):
- Prices double
- Wages double
- Real output (Y) unchanged
```

## Key Differences
| Feature | Short-Run | Long-Run |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Real Variables | Affected | Not affected |
| Price Level | Sticky | Fully adjusts |
| Duration | Temporary | Permanent |
| QTM Applies | Partially | Fully |

This explains why the QTM equation (π = g_M - g_Y) works better for long-run analysis, as shown in your notes about inflation and deflation causes.
