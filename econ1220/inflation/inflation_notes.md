# Tracking Inflation - Notes

## Key Definitions
- **Inflation**: The general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an economy
- **Price Level**: Measured using a hypothetical basket of goods and services that represents typical consumer purchases
- **Inflation Rate**: The percentage change in price levels over time (year to year or etc)
- **Index Number**: A unit-free number derived from price levels that simplifies inflation rate calculations

## How Price Levels Are Measured

### The Basket of Goods Approach
- Economists select a representative basket of goods and services typically purchased
- Price changes are tracked over time for this consistent basket
- Prices are weighted based on consumption patterns (items people spend more on have greater weight)
- Example: Housing price changes matter more than carrot price changes

### Why Simple Averages Don't Work
- Not all products have equal importance in consumer spending
- Using a simple average of prices would misrepresent actual cost of living changes
- Instead, a weighted average based on actual quantities purchased is used

## Index Numbers Explained

### Purpose of Index Numbers
- Convert complex dollar values into easy-to-understand reference points
- Allow for quick visual comparison of inflation rates
- Remove dollar signs and units for simplified analysis

### How Index Numbers Work
1. Choose a base year (assigned value of 100)
2. Express other years' values relative to the base year
3. Formula: (Cost in given year ÷ Cost in base year) × 100

### Key Properties of Index Numbers
- No units attached (no dollar signs or percentage signs)
- Base year choice is arbitrary and won't affect calculated inflation rates
- Makes inflation rates easier to "eyeball" (e.g., change from 100 to 103 is clearly about 3%)

## Calculating Inflation Rates

### Basic Formula
Inflation rate = (New index - Old index) ÷ Old index × 100%

### Example Calculation
If price index changes from 93.4 to 99.5:
- Inflation rate = (99.5 - 93.4) ÷ 93.4 = 0.065 = 6.5%

## Historical Price Comparisons

### 1970 vs 2014 Examples
| Item | 1970 | 2014 |
|------|------|------|
| Pound of ground beef | $0.66 | $4.16 |
| Movie ticket | $1.55 | $8.17 |
| New home (median) | $22,000 | $280,000 |
| Gallon of gasoline | $0.36 | $3.36 |
| Average manufacturing wage | $3.23 | $19.55 |

### Purchasing Power Perspective
- $1 in 2014 had approximately the same purchasing power as $0.18 in 1972
- Inflation affects not just goods and services but also wages and income levels
- While wages increased nearly six-fold from 1970 to 2014, workers weren't six times more productive

## Common Misconceptions

1. **Index Numbers Are Not Percentages**: Though they can be used to calculate percentages, they themselves don't have percentage signs
2. **Base Year Is Arbitrary**: Any base year will yield the same inflation rate calculations
3. **All Price Changes Aren't Inflation**: Individual price changes due to supply and demand differ from general inflation

## Practice Applications
- When analyzing inflation data, always check which year is being used as the base year
- Remember that official inflation statistics periodically update the base year
- Consider how different demographic groups might experience different effective inflation rates
