# Comprehensive Inflation Notes

## Lesson Overview
You just got a raise! But wait: was that raise really a raise? The third of our three key macroeconomic indicators, the inflation rate, can help you figure that out. Inflation is an increase in the overall price level. The official inflation rate is tracked by calculating changes in a measure called the consumer price index (CPI). The CPI tracks changes in the cost of living over time. Like other economic measures it does a pretty good job of this. But it does have some limitations, such as substitution bias, which can overstate how much the cost of living really has changed.

## Key Terms and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **inflation** | A sustained increase in the overall price level in the economy, which reduces the purchasing power of a dollar |
| **inflation rate** | The pace at which the overall price level is increasing; this is the percentage increase in the price level from one period to the next |
| **deflation** | A sustained decrease in the overall price level in the economy; deflation occurs if the inflation rate is negative |
| **disinflation** | A slowing of the rate of inflation; for example if the rate of inflation is 5% in 2016 and 3% in 2017, there is still inflation in 2017. Prices are just not rising as fast as they were before |
| **aggregate price level** | A single number that summarizes all prices in an economy; price indices are frequently used to represent the aggregate price level |
| **price index** | A measure that calculates the changing cost of purchasing a particular (and unchanging) combination of goods (called a "market basket") each year; the consumer price index and the producer price index are examples |
| **consumer price index (CPI)** | An index that calculates the cost of a market basket of goods purchased by a typical family that lives in an urban area; the purpose of the CPI is to track changes in the cost of living over time |
| **market basket** | The combination of goods that are used to calculate a price index; the goods stay the same from year to year |
| **base year** | A reference year to which variables are compared; for example, the current CPI in the United States uses 1983 as its base year, so all values of the CPI compare the current to 1983 |
| **real variables** | Variables that are adjusted for the rate of inflation that represent the true value of something (such as real interest, real income, or real GDP); for example if your boss gives you a 10% raise, but the purchasing power of your money has decreased by 8% because of inflation, your raise is really only worth 2% |
| **nominal variables** | Variables such as wages, income, or interest that have not been adjusted for the rate of inflation; you can think of nominal variables as the "sticker price." The bank tells you they will pay you 3% interest, but the real interest rate that tells you what you are actually earning |
| **purchasing power** | What can actually be bought with money; if you walk into a store with $10 and want to buy apples that cost $1 each, the purchasing power of your $10 is 10 apples; If the next day the price of apples increases to $2, you can only buy 5 apples, so the purchasing power of your $10 has decreased |
| **aggregate price level** | a single number that summarizes all prices in an economy; price indices are frequently used to represent the aggregate price level. |
| **real interest rate** | The interest rate earned that reflects the actual purchasing power of that interest; for example if a bank pays 3% interest, but there is 2% inflation, you really have only gained 1% interest because the purchasing power of your interest has decreased |

## Key Takeaways

### The Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in income a consumer needs to maintain the same standard of living over time
- The CPI is meant to reflect changes in the cost of living for a typical urban household
- Example: Suppose every household buys 2 bottles of cod liver oil, 10 loaves of bread, and 8 dog treats every week. A consumer price index tracks changes in the price of this unchanging collection of goods over time to measure changes in the cost of living for this household

### How the CPI is Calculated
1. Define a fixed basket of goods and services that represents what a typical household buys
2. Find the prices of those goods in different time periods
3. Calculate the cost of the basket in each period
4. Choose a base year and express the cost in other years relative to that base year

**Detailed Example**:
```
Market basket: 2 bottles of cod liver oil, 10 loaves of bread, 8 dog treats

Cost in base year:
- Cod liver oil: $5 each × 2 = $10
- Bread: $2 each × 10 = $20
- Dog treats: $1 each × 8 = $8
Total cost in base year = $38

Cost in current year:
- Cod liver oil: $8 each × 2 = $16
- Bread: $3 each × 10 = $30
- Dog treats: $1.50 each × 8 = $12
Total cost in current year = $58

CPI for current year = (Cost in current year ÷ Cost in base year) × 100
CPI for current year = ($58 ÷ $38) × 100 = 152.6
```

### How the CPI is Used to Calculate the Inflation Rate
- The inflation rate is determined by calculating the percentage change in a price index
- The inflation rate tells us the percentage by which the price level is changing from period to period

**Formula**:
```
Inflation rate = [(CPI_new - CPI_old) ÷ CPI_old] × 100
```

**Example**:
```
CPI in 2022: 145
CPI in 2023: 152.6

Inflation rate = [(152.6 - 145) ÷ 145] × 100 = 5.24%
```

### Adjusting Nominal Variables into Real Variables
- Real variables are nominal variables deflated by the price level
- Examples of real variables are real wage or real interest rate

**Example - Real Interest Rate**:
```
Nominal interest rate: 8%
Inflation rate: 5%
Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation rate
Real interest rate = 8% - 5% = 3%
```

**Why it's 3%**: Because that is how much more you can buy when you take your money out after a year, accounting for inflation.

## Limitations of CPI as a Measure of the Cost of Living

### Substitution Bias
- **Problem**: CPI assumes people buy the same basket of goods regardless of price changes
- **Reality**: People substitute away from goods whose prices rise disproportionately
- **Result**: CPI overstates inflation because it doesn't account for substitution
- **Example**: If beef prices double, consumers might buy more chicken instead, but CPI assumes they still buy the same amount of beef at the higher price

### Quality/New Goods Bias
- **Problem**: CPI doesn't fully account for quality improvements or new products
- **Reality**: Products improve over time and new products emerge that offer better value
- **Result**: CPI overstates inflation by not accounting for improved quality or new goods
- **Example**: A 2013 Volvo Station Wagon costs more than a 1973 Volvo Station Wagon partly because the newer model has seatbelts in the backseat, FM radio, and air conditioning—features the older model lacked
- **Example**: VCRs and personal computers were widely available in early 1980s but not added to the CPI basket until 1987

## Key Equations
For any year, t:

CPI_t = (Cost of basket in year t / Cost of basket in base year) × 100

Inflation rate = [(CPI_new - CPI_old) / CPI_old] × 100

## Common Misperceptions

1. **Inflation Is Not Additive**
   - Misconception: 2% inflation per year for 10 years = 20% total inflation
   - Reality: Inflation compounds over time
   - Example: A $100 chicken coop with 2% annual inflation:
     - After year 1: $102
     - After year 2: $104.04 (not $104)
     - After year 10: $121.90 (21.9% total increase)

2. **CPI Is Not the Inflation Rate**
   - Misconception: Once we calculate the CPI, we have the inflation rate
   - Reality: CPI is a measure of price level; inflation rate is the percentage change in CPI
   - We must calculate the percentage change between two periods to find inflation

3. **Multiple Price Indices Exist**
   - There are several different price indices used to calculate the rate of inflation
   - The CPI is the one used to calculate the official rate of inflation (reported in news)
   - Other indices include:
     - Producer Price Index (PPI)
     - GDP Deflator
     - Employment Cost Index
     - International Price Index

4. **"Index" Is Simply a Comparative Measure**
   - The term "index" might sound strange, but it's simply any measure that compares a value in one period to the value in a base year

## Discussion Questions:

1. What are some reasons that the CPI might not capture the true rate of inflation?
   - The CPI doesn't account for substitution bias
   - It doesn't properly reflect quality improvements in products
   - It lags in introducing new products into the basket
   - It doesn't account for consumer behavior changes during price increases

2. How might changes in spending habits of households over a 20-year period change? How does this impact CPI as a measure of the cost of living?
   - Technology changes (people spend more on electronics, streaming services)
   - Food preference changes (organic, specialty foods)
   - Housing preference changes
   - These changes make a fixed basket less representative of actual spending patterns

3. Practice Problem: The CPI in the nation of Montrose was 220 in 2016 and 200 in 2015. What is the rate of inflation between 2015 and 2016?
   - Inflation rate = [(220 - 200) ÷ 200] × 100 = 10%
