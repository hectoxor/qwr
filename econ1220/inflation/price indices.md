# Price Indices and Inflation

## Basic Inflation Concepts

### Key Terms
- **Inflation**: A sustained increase in overall price levels
  - Example: If a bag of chips costs $2.00 this year and $2.10 next year
  
- **Deflation**: A sustained decrease in overall price levels
  - Example: If housing prices fall by 5% across the board
  
- **Disinflation**: Slowing of inflation rate (still positive but less than before)
  - Example: Inflation rate changing from 5% to 3%
  
- **Purchasing Power**: What money can actually buy
  - Example: If you have $10 and apples cost $1 each, you can buy 10 apples
  - If apple prices rise to $2 each, your $10 now only buys 5 apples

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

### What is CPI?
- Measures changes in the cost of a fixed basket of goods over time
- Represents the spending of a typical urban household
- Used to track changes in cost of living

### How CPI is Calculated
1. Define a market basket of common goods and services
2. Track prices of these items over time
3. Compare current cost to base year cost

**Formula**: CPI = (Cost of basket in current year / Cost of basket in base year) × 100

**Example**:
```
Market basket: 2 bottles of medicine, 10 loaves of bread, 8 dog treats

Cost in 2010 (base year):
- Medicine: $5 each × 2 = $10
- Bread: $2 each × 10 = $20
- Dog treats: $1 each × 8 = $8
Total: $38

Cost in 2023:
- Medicine: $8 each × 2 = $16
- Bread: $3 each × 10 = $30
- Dog treats: $1.50 each × 8 = $12
Total: $58

CPI for 2023 = (Cost in 2023 ÷ Cost in base year) × 100
CPI for 2023 = ($58 ÷ $38) × 100 = 152.6
```

### Calculating Inflation Rate
- **Formula**: Inflation rate = [(New CPI - Old CPI) ÷ Old CPI] × 100

**Example**:
```
CPI in 2022: 145
CPI in 2023: 152.6

Inflation rate = [(152.6 - 145) ÷ 145] × 100 = 5.24%
```

**Practice Problem**: 
The CPI in Montrose was 220 in 2016 and 200 in 2015. The inflation rate is:
[(220 - 200) ÷ 200] × 100 = 10%

## Real vs. Nominal Values

### Converting Nominal to Real
- **Nominal values**: Dollar amounts not adjusted for inflation ("sticker price")
- **Real values**: Adjusted for inflation (what you can actually buy)

**Example - Real Interest Rate**:
```
Nominal interest rate: 8%
Inflation rate: 5%
Real interest rate = 8% - 5% = 3%
```

**Example - Real Wage**:
```
2022 salary: $60,000
2023 salary: $63,000 (5% raise)
Inflation: 5.24%

Real change in purchasing power = 5% - 5.24% = -0.24%
Your purchasing power actually decreased slightly!
```

## Limitations of CPI

### Substitution Bias
- Problem: CPI assumes people buy the same goods regardless of price changes
- Reality: People substitute away from goods that become more expensive
- Result: CPI overstates inflation

**Example**: If beef prices double, people buy more chicken, but CPI assumes they still buy the same amount of beef

### Quality Change Bias
- Problem: CPI doesn't fully account for quality improvements
- Example: A $1,000 laptop today is far more powerful than a $1,000 laptop from 10 years ago
- Example: 2013 Volvo Station Wagon costs more than 1973 model, but has seatbelts, FM radio, and air conditioning that the older model lacked

## Common Misunderstandings

1. **Inflation compounds over time**
   - 2% inflation for 10 years ≠ 20% total inflation
   - Actual total: 21.9% (because each year's inflation applies to the already-inflated price)
   - Example: A $100 chicken coop with 2% annual inflation would cost $121.90 after 10 years

2. **CPI vs. Inflation Rate**
   - CPI itself is not the inflation rate
   - Inflation rate is the percentage change in CPI

3. **Multiple Price Indices**
   - CPI is the most commonly used measure for consumer inflation
   - Other indices include PPI (Producer Price Index) and GDP Deflator
