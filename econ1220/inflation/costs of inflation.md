# Costs and Effects of Inflation

## Lesson Overview
Inflation can get a bad rap. For instance, some people think inflation makes everyone worse off. But it turns out that there are both winners and losers from inflation. In general, if you owe money that has to be paid back with a fixed amount of interest, you are going to benefit from unexpected inflation. On the other hand, if someone owes you money, when there is unexpected inflation the money you are paid back won't be worth as much as the money you loaned out.

## Key Terms and Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **unanticipated inflation** | When the price level increases at a faster pace than expected (e.g., expected 5%, actual 8%) |
| **unanticipated disinflation** | When the price level increases at a slower pace than anticipated (e.g., expected 5%, actual 2%) |
| **unanticipated deflation** | When the price level decreases when it was expected to increase (e.g., expected 2%, actual -2%) |
| **wealth redistribution** | When the real value of wealth is transferred from one agent to another; when inflation is higher than borrowers and lenders expected, wealth is transferred from lenders to borrowers |
| **lender** | An agent (usually a bank) or a person (e.g., bond holder) who makes money available to another agent, with the agreement that the money will be repaid (usually with interest) |
| **borrower** | An agent that has received money from another agent with the agreement that the money will be repaid (usually with interest) |
| **saver** | An agent that is not spending some of their income; usually if money is saved it is put in some sort of interest-earning asset (like a savings account or a bond) or purchasing some other financial asset (such as stocks and bonds) |
| **bond** | An asset that is a promise to pay a fixed amount at some point in the future; e.g., the government sells Tony a bond for $100 with the promise of paying him back $104 in one year |

## Redistribution Effects of Inflation

### Unexpected Inflation

Unexpected inflation arbitrarily redistributes wealth from one group to another group, such as from borrowers to lenders. When people decide to borrow money or lend money, they often consider what they think the rate of inflation will be. When the rate of inflation is different than anticipated, the amount of interest repaid or earned will also be different than what they expected.

#### Winners: Borrowers
- Borrowers benefit from unanticipated inflation
- The money they pay back is worth less than the money they borrowed
- The real value of their debt decreases
- Example: Student loan borrowers when inflation rises unexpectedly

#### Losers: Lenders and Savers
- Lenders are hurt by unanticipated inflation
- The money they get paid back has less purchasing power than the money they loaned out
- Example: Banks that issued fixed-rate mortgages before inflation increased
- Savers with fixed interest rates earn less in real terms than expected

## Redistribution Effects of Disinflation and Deflation

Unanticipated disinflation or deflation (when the inflation rate is lower than expected or negative) has the opposite effect as unanticipated inflation.

#### Winners: Lenders
- Lenders are helped by unanticipated disinflation or deflation
- The money they get paid back has more purchasing power than expected
- Example: Banks that issued loans before deflation occurred

#### Losers: Borrowers
- Borrowers are hurt by unanticipated disinflation or deflation
- With deflation, they pay back debts with money worth more than what they borrowed
- Example: Homeowners with mortgages during periods of deflation

## Policy Implications

Most policies that target inflation are aimed at maintaining small and predictable rates of inflation. Inflation that is too close to zero runs the risk of becoming negative, and deflation becomes a possibility. 

- Deflation has a very damaging impact on an economy
- Deflation is associated with particularly severe recessions and depressions
- When policymakers talk about "lowering inflation," their objective is slowing down the rate of inflation (disinflation), not creating deflation
- Goal: small, stable, and predictable inflation rates (often around 2%)

## Common Misperceptions About Inflation

1. **"Inflation is bad for everyone"**
   - Reality: Inflation creates winners (borrowers) and losers (lenders)
   - People who have borrowed money benefit from higher inflation when they repay
   - The effective interest rate borrowers pay is lower thanks to inflation

2. **"Disinflation and deflation are good for everyone"**
   - Reality: Deflation increases the purchasing power of money
   - People who have borrowed money pay back with money worth more than what they borrowed
   - Deflation effectively increases the interest rate borrowers pay

3. **"Inflation should always be avoided"**
   - Reality: Deflation has such a destructive impact on an economy that most policymakers agree avoiding deflation is more important
   - Goal is not zero inflation, but small and predictable inflation rates

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Student Loan
You take out a $50,000 loan from the Bank of Baloney to pay for college, with five years to repay.
- If inflation unexpectedly increases: You benefit, the bank loses
- Why? You're repaying with dollars that are worth less than expected

### Example 2: Large Institutional Loan
The Lady of Wintersfell borrows $2.5 million from the Iron Bank of Bravodos to be repaid in five years.
- If unanticipated deflation occurs: The Lady of Wintersfell (borrower) is hurt, the Iron Bank (lender) benefits
- Why? The Lady must repay with money that is now worth more than what she borrowed

### Example 3: Savings Account
You inherit $100 and place it in a secure savings account with a fixed interest rate.
- If inflation is higher than anticipated: Your expected wealth decreases
- Why? The interest you earn buys less than you expected it would
- The real return on your savings (nominal interest rate minus inflation) is lower than anticipated
