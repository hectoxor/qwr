# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

## Definition
PPP is the exchange rate at which the currency of one country would have to be converted into another country's currency to buy the same amount of goods and services in each country.

## Basic Formula
```markdown
PPP Exchange Rate = Price of Basket in Country A ÷ Price of Same Basket in Country B

Example:
Big Mac in US: $5.00
Big Mac in UK: £3.80
PPP Exchange Rate = $5.00 ÷ £3.80 = 1.32 USD/GBP
```

## Types of PPP

### 1. Absolute PPP
```markdown
Same good should cost the same everywhere when converted to same currency

Example:
If laptop costs:
- US: $1000
- Japan: ¥100,000
Then PPP rate = $1000 ÷ ¥100,000 = 0.01 USD/JPY
```

### 2. Relative PPP
```markdown
Changes in relative prices should be equal across countries

Example:
US Inflation: 3%
UK Inflation: 5%
Expected currency adjustment: -2% (3% - 5%)
```

## Real-World Applications

### 1. International Comparisons
```markdown
GDP Comparison:
Country A: $1000 GDP, High prices
Country B: $800 GDP, Low prices
PPP-adjusted comparison might show similar living standards
```

### 2. Currency Valuation
```markdown
If Market Rate > PPP Rate: Currency overvalued
If Market Rate < PPP Rate: Currency undervalued
```

Remember: PPP helps compare living standards across countries by accounting for different price levels.
