Investments are always done by private firms

Net investment is the amount of additional capital that is added to capital stock. It consists of all newly created capital minus the capital that has worn out and must be replaced

# Key points
- The size of a nation’s economy is commonly expressed as its gross domestic product, or GDP, which measures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year.

GDP is measured by taking the quantities of all final goods and services produced and sold in markets, multiplying them by their current prices, and adding up the total.
- GDP can be measured either by the sum of what is purchased in the economy using the expenditures approach or by income earned on what is produced using the income approach.
- The expenditures approach represents aggregate demand (the demand for all goods and services in an economy) and can be divided into consumption, investment, government spending, exports, and imports. What is produced in the economy can be divided into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories.
- To avoid double counting—adding the value of output to the GDP more than once—GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.
- The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance. If a nation's imports exceed its exports, the nation is said to have a trade deficit. If a nation's exports exceed its imports, it is said to have a trade surplus.


GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

C (Consumption): Household spending on goods and services

I (Investment): Business spending on capital goods, inventory, and construction

G (Government): Government spending on goods and services

X (Exports): Value of goods produced domestically but sold abroad

M (Imports): Value of goods produced abroad but purchased domestically




# Understanding GDP in Macroeconomics

## What is GDP?

**Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific time period (usually a year or quarter). It's the primary measure of a nation's economic output and health.

## The Three Approaches to Calculating GDP

### 1. Expenditure Approach
GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)

- **C (Consumption)**: Household spending on goods and services
- **I (Investment)**: Business spending on capital goods, inventory, and construction
- **G (Government)**: Government spending on goods and services
- **X (Exports)**: Value of goods produced domestically but sold abroad
- **M (Imports)**: Value of goods produced abroad but purchased domestically

### 2. Income Approach
GDP = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit + Indirect Taxes + Depreciation + Net Foreign Factor Income

This measures GDP by adding up all the income earned from producing goods and services.

### 3. Production (Output) Approach
GDP = Total Value of Goods and Services - Intermediate Goods

This measures GDP by calculating the value added at each stage of production.

## Key GDP Concepts for AP Macroeconomics

### Nominal vs. Real GDP
- **Nominal GDP**: GDP measured at current market prices
- **Real GDP**: GDP adjusted for inflation (using a base year's prices)

### GDP Deflator
- Formula: (Nominal GDP ÷ Real GDP) × 100
- Measures inflation across all goods and services in an economy

### GDP Per Capita
- GDP divided by population
- Measures standard of living

## What GDP Does and Doesn't Measure

### Does Measure:
- Market production
- National output/income
- Economic growth

### Doesn't Measure:
- Underground economy
- Non-market activities (household work)
- Quality of life/happiness
- Income distribution
- Environmental impacts

## GDP and the Business Cycle

GDP helps identify the phases of business cycles:
- **Expansion**: Rising GDP
- **Peak**: Highest point of GDP
- **Contraction/Recession**: Falling GDP (recession = two consecutive quarters of negative growth)
- **Trough**: Lowest point of GDP

Understanding GDP is crucial for analyzing economic health, comparing economies, and formulating economic policy—all key topics on the AP Macroeconomics exam.
