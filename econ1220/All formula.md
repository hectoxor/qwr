Inflation Rate = ((Current Deflator - Previous Deflator) ÷ Previous Deflator) × 100

GDP Deflator = (Nominal GDP ÷ Real GDP) × 100

Unemployment Rate = (Number of Unemployed ÷ Labor Force) × 100 Remember that the denominator (labor force) can change, affecting the rate even when jobs are added.

- Labor Force Participation: Only people who are either employed or actively seeking work count as being in the labor force.

- Frictional Unemployment: Normal, typically short-term unemployment that occurs during the job-matching process.


- Natural Rate: The "normal" unemployment rate in a healthy economy at full employment.

Is the unemployment rate when the economy is at full employment
Includes frictional and structural unemployment but not cyclical unemployment
Serves as an equilibrium around which actual unemployment fluctuates
Is observed over the long term


Price Index: To convert between years, multiply by (new price index ÷ base price index).


Money supply growth = Nominal GDP growth
Inflation rate = Nominal GDP growth - Real GDP growth


Quantity Theory: Money growth = Inflation + Real GDP growth (when velocity is constant)
