# VMPL Equilibrium in Labor Market

## Basic Framework

### Definition
Labor market equilibrium occurs where:
```
VMPL = Real Wage
(Value of Marginal Product of Labor = Real Wage Rate)
```

### Why VMPL = Labor Demand
1. Profit-maximizing firms hire until:
   ```
   VMPL = W (wage)
   Because:
   - If VMPL > W: Profitable to hire more
   - If VMPL < W: Losing money on worker
   - If VMPL = W: Optimal hiring level
   ```

## Equilibrium Analysis

### Components
```
VMPL = MPL × P
Where:
- MPL = Marginal Product of Labor (diminishing)
- P = Price of output (fixed in perfect competition)
- W/P = Real wage (wage adjusted for price level)
```

### Example: Pizza Restaurant
```
Given:
- Pizza price (P) = $20
- MPL schedule:
  Worker 1: 10 pizzas/hour
  Worker 2: 8 pizzas/hour
  Worker 3: 5 pizzas/hour
  Worker 4: 2 pizzas/hour

VMPL Schedule:
Worker 1: 10 × $20 = $200
Worker 2: 8 × $20 = $160
Worker 3: 5 × $20 = $100
Worker 4: 2 × $20 = $40

If market wage = $120/hour:
- Hire workers 1 and 2 (VMPL > W)
- Don't hire workers 3 and 4 (VMPL < W)
Equilibrium: 2 workers
```

## Shifts in Equilibrium

### 1. Price Changes
```
If pizza price increases to $25:
Original VMPL × (25/20) = New VMPL

New VMPL Schedule:
Worker 1: $250 (was $200)
Worker 2: $200 (was $160)
Worker 3: $125 (was $100)
Worker 4: $50  (was $40)

At W = $120:
Now hire 3 workers (VMPL > W for first 3)
```

### 2. Productivity Changes
```
Technology improves MPL by 50%:
Original VMPL × 1.5 = New VMPL

New VMPL Schedule:
Worker 1: $300 (was $200)
Worker 2: $240 (was $160)
Worker 3: $150 (was $100)
Worker 4: $60  (was $40)

At W = $120:
Now hire 3 workers instead of 2
```

## Market-Wide Equilibrium

### Perfect Competition Case
```
All firms face same:
- Output price (P)
- Wage rate (W)
- Technology (MPL function)

Equilibrium conditions:
1. VMPL = W for each firm
2. Labor supply = Sum of all firms' labor demand
3. No firm wants to hire more/fewer workers
```

### Example: Industry-Wide
```
Assume 100 identical pizza restaurants:
Market wage = $120/hour
Each restaurant hires 2 workers

Industry equilibrium:
- Total employment = 200 workers
- Each worker paid $120/hour
- Each restaurant maximizing profit
```

## Non-Equilibrium Adjustments

### 1. Wage Too High
```
If W = $150/hour:
VMPL Schedule:
Worker 1: $200 > $150 → Hire
Worker 2: $160 > $150 → Hire
Worker 3: $100 < $150 → Don't hire

Result:
- Firms hire fewer workers
- Excess labor supply
- Wage pressure downward
```

### 2. Wage Too Low
```
If W = $80/hour:
VMPL Schedule:
Worker 1: $200 > $80 → Hire
Worker 2: $160 > $80 → Hire
Worker 3: $100 > $80 → Hire
Worker 4: $40 < $80 → Don't hire

Result:
- Firms want more workers
- Labor shortage
- Wage pressure upward
```

## Policy Applications

### 1. Minimum Wage
```
If minimum wage > VMPL:
- Firms reduce employment
- Workers willing but unable to work
- Creates unemployment

Example:
Minimum wage = $130
Only workers 1-2 will be hired
Workers 3-4 unemployed despite willingness to work for less
```

### 2. Technical Change
```
When automation increases MPL:
- VMPL curve shifts up
- More workers hired at each wage
- Higher equilibrium wages

Example:
New software doubles productivity
Original VMPL: $200, $160, $100, $40
New VMPL: $400, $320, $200, $80
At W = $120: Now hire 3 workers
```
