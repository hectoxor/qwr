# Value of Marginal Product of Labor (VMPL)

## Basic Definition
VMPL = Value of additional output produced by one more unit of labor

## Core Formula
VMPL = MPL × P
Where:
- MPL = Marginal Product of Labor (additional output per additional worker)
- P = Price of output
- VMPL = Value of that additional output in dollars

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Car Wash
```
Scenario:
- Each car wash costs customers $10
- First worker can wash 8 cars per hour
- Second worker can wash 6 more cars
- Third worker can wash 4 more cars

VMPL Calculations:
Worker 1: 8 cars × $10 = $80/hour
Worker 2: 6 cars × $10 = $60/hour
Worker 3: 4 cars × $10 = $40/hour
```

### Example 2: Pizza Restaurant
```
Scenario:
- Each pizza sells for $15
- MPL schedule:
  Worker 1: 10 pizzas/hour
  Worker 2: 8 pizzas/hour
  Worker 3: 5 pizzas/hour
  Worker 4: 2 pizzas/hour

VMPL Calculations:
Worker 1: 10 × $15 = $150/hour
Worker 2: 8 × $15 = $120/hour
Worker 3: 5 × $15 = $75/hour
Worker 4: 2 × $15 = $30/hour
```

## Hiring Decision Rule

### Basic Rule
Hire workers as long as: VMPL > Wage Rate
Stop hiring when: VMPL = Wage Rate

### Example Application
```
Given:
- Wage rate = $50/hour
- Pizza price = $15
- MPL schedule as above

Hiring Decision:
Worker 1: VMPL = $150 > $50 → Hire
Worker 2: VMPL = $120 > $50 → Hire
Worker 3: VMPL = $75 > $50 → Hire
Worker 4: VMPL = $30 < $50 → Don't hire

Optimal number of workers = 3
```

## Factors Affecting VMPL

### 1. Price Changes
```
If pizza price increases from $15 to $20:
Worker 1: 10 × $20 = $200 (↑ from $150)
Worker 2: 8 × $20 = $160 (↑ from $120)
Worker 3: 5 × $20 = $100 (↑ from $75)
Worker 4: 2 × $20 = $40 (↑ from $30)
```

### 2. Technology Changes
```
New equipment improves MPL by 50%:
Original MPL × 1.5 × Price = New VMPL
Worker 1: (10 × 1.5) × $15 = $225
Worker 2: (8 × 1.5) × $15 = $180
```

## VMPL and Labor Demand Curve

### Key Points
1. VMPL curve IS the labor demand curve
2. Diminishing returns create downward slope
3. Changes in price shift the curve

### Graphical Representation
```
Wage Rate ($)     VMPL (Labor Demand)
    ^             /
    |           /
 100 |         /
    |        /
 50  |      /
    |     /

    +------------------>
    0   1   2   3   4   Workers
```

## Common Applications

### 1. Minimum Wage Analysis
```
If minimum wage = $60/hour:
- Only hire workers with VMPL > $60
- In pizza example: Hire 2 workers instead of 3
```

### 2. Price Change Effects
```
When output price rises:
- VMPL increases proportionally
- Labor demand curve shifts right
- More workers hired at each wage level
```

### 3. Productivity Changes
```
When technology improves MPL:
- VMPL increases
- Labor demand curve shifts right
- Can hire more workers at same wage
```

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1
```
A factory produces widgets:
- Price per widget = $5
- MPL schedule:
  Worker 1: 20 widgets/hour
  Worker 2: 15 widgets/hour
  Worker 3: 10 widgets/hour
- Wage rate = $40/hour

Calculate:
a) VMPL for each worker
b) Optimal number of workers
```

### Solution
```
a) VMPL calculations:
   Worker 1: 20 × $5 = $100/hour
   Worker 2: 15 × $5 = $75/hour
   Worker 3: 10 × $5 = $50/hour

b) Hire workers where VMPL > $40
   Therefore, hire 2 workers
```
