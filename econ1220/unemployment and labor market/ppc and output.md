# Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) & Unemployment Notes

## PPC Basics
- **Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)**: Shows maximum possible output combinations an economy can produce with available resources
- Each point ON the curve represents **full employment** of resources (operating at maximum efficiency)
- Points INSIDE the curve represent **underutilization** of resources (operating inefficiently)

## Operating ON the PPC
- Economy uses all available resources efficiently
- Unemployment equals the **Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)**
- Only frictional and structural unemployment exist
- **NO cyclical unemployment**
- Example: Economy with 5% unemployment, all of which is frictional (job searchers) and structural (skill mismatch)

## Operating INSIDE the PPC
- Economy has idle or underutilized resources
- Unemployment rate **exceeds** the Natural Rate of Unemployment
- Cyclical unemployment exists
- Represents economic inefficiency or recession
- Example: Economy with 9% unemployment during recession (5% natural + 4% cyclical)

## Key Relationships
- **Recession** = Economy moves INSIDE the PPC (increasing cyclical unemployment)
- **Economic growth** = PPC shifts OUTWARD (capacity increases)
- **Full employment** ≠ Zero unemployment (still includes frictional and structural)

Point A: On the curve - economy at full employment (only natural unemployment) Point B: Inside the curve - economy with cyclical unemployment

## Moving Toward the PPC
- Reducing cyclical unemployment moves economy toward PPC
- Government policies (fiscal/monetary) aim to reduce cyclical unemployment
- Reducing structural unemployment through education/training can also help move toward PPC

Remember: Even at full capacity (on the PPC), some unemployment (the natural rate) always exists in a healthy economy.


# Full Employment Output Notes for AP Macroeconomics

## Definition
- **Full Employment Output**: The level of real GDP an economy produces when it is at its natural rate of unemployment
- Also called "potential output" or "potential GDP"
- Represents the maximum **sustainable** level of production without causing accelerating inflation

## Relationship to PPC
- Full employment output occurs when economy is operating **ON** the Production Possibilities Curve
- Points **ON** the PPC = economy using all resources efficiently (at full employment)
- Points **INSIDE** the PPC = economy producing below full employment output
- The entire PPC itself represents different combinations of full employment output

## Relationship to Unemployment
- At full employment output, unemployment equals the **Natural Rate of Unemployment (NRU)**
- Only frictional and structural unemployment exist
- **No cyclical unemployment** at full employment output
- Example: If NRU = 5%, then full employment output occurs when unemployment rate = 5%

## Key Points
- Full employment output ≠ zero unemployment
- Full employment output ≠ maximum possible output in short term (economy could temporarily exceed it)
- Full employment output can grow over time (shifting the PPC outward)
- When actual output < full employment output:
  - Recessionary gap exists
  - Unemployment exceeds natural rate
  - Economy operating inside PPC

## AP Exam Connections
- Questions often ask about relationships between:
  - Full employment output and location on PPC
  - Output gaps and unemployment types
  - Government policies to reach full employment output

Full employment output represents the economy's "sweet spot" - using resources efficiently while maintaining sustainable production levels.
