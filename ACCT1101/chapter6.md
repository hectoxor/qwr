# Chapter 6: Reporting Sales Revenue

## Revenue Recognition Principles
- **5-Step Model**:
  1. Identify the contract
  2. Identify performance obligations
  3. Determine transaction price
  4. Allocate price to obligations
  5. Recognize revenue when obligations satisfied

## Revenue Recognition Examples

### 5-Step Model Applied

#### Example 1: Retail Sale
1. **Contract**: Customer purchases TV for $1,000
2. **Performance Obligation**: Deliver TV
3. **Transaction Price**: $1,000
4. **Allocation**: Single obligation, full amount
5. **Recognition**: When TV is delivered
```
Dr. Cash                    1,000
    Cr. Sales Revenue            1,000
```

#### Example 2: Service Contract with Multiple Deliverables
1. **Contract**: $5,000 IT implementation with 1-year support
2. **Performance Obligations**: (1) Setup, (2) Support
3. **Transaction Price**: $5,000
4. **Allocation**: Setup $3,500, Support $1,500
5. **Recognition**: Setup when completed, support over 12 months
```
Upon completion of setup:
Dr. Cash/Accounts Receivable    5,000
    Cr. Sales Revenue               3,500
    Cr. Unearned Revenue            1,500

Monthly support (1/12 of $1,500):
Dr. Unearned Revenue             125
    Cr. Service Revenue              125
```

## Sales Returns and Allowances
- Contra-revenue accounts
- Reduce gross sales to determine net sales

### Journal Entries

#### Sales Return (customer returns product)
```
Dr. Sales Returns & Allowances    500
    Cr. Accounts Receivable/Cash      500

(Cost of inventory returned)
Dr. Inventory                    300
    Cr. Cost of Goods Sold           300
```

#### Sales Allowance (price reduction)
```
Dr. Sales Returns & Allowances    150
    Cr. Accounts Receivable          150
```

### Income Statement Presentation
```
Gross Sales                      $100,000
Less: Sales Returns & Allowances   ($5,000)
Net Sales                         $95,000
```

## Sales Discounts
- Cash/trade discounts
- Timing considerations (2/10, n/30)

### Cash Discount Example (2/10, n/30)
Terms: 2% discount if paid within 10 days, full amount due in 30 days

```
January 5: Sale on credit
Dr. Accounts Receivable       1,000
    Cr. Sales Revenue              1,000

January 12: Customer pays within discount period
Dr. Cash                        980
Dr. Sales Discounts              20
    Cr. Accounts Receivable       1,000
```

### Discount Not Taken
```
February 1: Customer pays after discount period
Dr. Cash                      1,000
    Cr. Accounts Receivable       1,000
```

## Revenue Recognition Issues
- **Multiple deliverables**: Allocating transaction price
- **Long-term contracts**: Percentage-of-completion vs. completed contract
- **Principal vs. Agent**: Gross vs. net reporting

## Special Revenue Recognition Cases

### Long-Term Construction Contract
#### Percentage-of-Completion Method
```
Total contract:       $10,000,000
Cost estimate:         $8,000,000
Year 1 costs:          $2,000,000 (25% complete)

Dr. Construction in Progress   2,000,000
    Cr. Cash/A/P                    2,000,000

Dr. A/R or Contract Asset      2,500,000
    Cr. Construction Revenue        2,500,000
    (25% of $10M contract price)
```

### Principal vs. Agent
#### Principal (gross reporting)
```
Dr. Cash                      1,000
    Cr. Sales Revenue              1,000
    
Dr. Cost of Goods Sold          700
    Cr. Inventory                    700
```

#### Agent (net reporting)
```
Dr. Cash                      1,000
    Cr. Liability to Principal       700
    Cr. Commission Revenue           300
