## Practice Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Comprehensive Adjusting Entries

**Problem:**  
DataTech Services has the following information at December 31, 2023 (year-end):

1. The company paid $18,000 for a 3-year insurance policy on July 1, 2023.
2. The company purchased $7,500 in office supplies during the year. A physical count on December 31 shows $2,800 in supplies remaining.
3. The company has office equipment worth $48,000 with a 5-year useful life and no salvage value (straight-line depreciation).
4. Employees earned $8,500 in salaries for the last week of December, to be paid on January 5.
5. The company received $30,000 on November 1 for a 6-month service contract.
6. The company earned $4,200 in interest on investments, to be received January 15.

Prepare all necessary adjusting entries.

**Solution:**

1. Insurance adjustment:
   ```
   Dr. Insurance Expense      3,000
       Cr. Prepaid Insurance        3,000
   (6 months expired: $18,000 ÷ 36 months × 6 months)
   ```

2. Supplies adjustment:
   ```
   Dr. Supplies Expense       4,700
       Cr. Supplies                 4,700
   ($7,500 - $2,800 supplies used)
   ```

3. Depreciation adjustment:
   ```
   Dr. Depreciation Expense   9,600
       Cr. Accumulated Depreciation   9,600
   ($48,000 ÷ 5 years = $9,600 per year)
   ```

4. Accrued salaries:
   ```
   Dr. Salary Expense         8,500
       Cr. Salaries Payable         8,500

   ```

5. Unearned revenue:
   ```
   Dr. Unearned Revenue      10,000
       Cr. Service Revenue         10,000
   (2 months earned: $30,000 ÷ 6 months × 2 months)
   ```

6. Accrued interest:
   ```
   Dr. Interest Receivable    4,200
       Cr. Interest Revenue         4,200
   (Interest earned but not yet received)
   ```

### Problem 3: Quality of Earnings Analysis

**Problem:**  
Analyze the accounting choices and quality of earnings for two companies:

**Company A:**
- Changed depreciation method from straight-line to accelerated this year
- Records revenue when contracts are signed, before delivery
- Frequently revises bad debt estimates downward
- Changed inventory valuation method from FIFO to LIFO this year

**Company B:**
- Has used straight-line depreciation consistently for 10 years
- Records revenue only when products are delivered
- Maintains consistent bad debt estimation methodology
- Uses FIFO consistently for inventory valuation

**Solution:**

**Company A Quality Analysis:**
- **Low Quality Indicators:**
  - Multiple accounting method changes in a single year
  - Aggressive revenue recognition (before delivery)
  - Potential manipulation of bad debt estimates
  - Inconsistent accounting policies suggest possible earnings management
  
**Company B Quality Analysis:**
- **High Quality Indicators:**
  - Consistent application of accounting methods
  - Conservative revenue recognition
  - Stable estimation methodology
  - Accounting choices focus on economic reality rather than reporting goals

**Financial Statement Impact:**
- Company A's financial statements are less reliable for forecasting future performance
- Company B's statements provide more meaningful trend analysis
- Investors should apply a higher risk premium when valuing Company A
- Company B's accounting transparency would likely result in lower cost of capital

### Problem 4: Adjusting Entry Effect on Financial Ratios

**Problem:**  
CloudSoft Inc. has the following pre-adjustment and post-adjustment account balances at December 31, 2023:

| Account | Pre-Adjustment | Post-Adjustment |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Current Assets | $85,000 | $78,000 |
| Total Assets | $220,000 | $213,000 |
| Current Liabilities | $40,000 | $48,000 |
| Total Liabilities | $90,000 | $98,000 |
| Net Income | $45,000 | $30,000 |
| Total Revenue | $250,000 | $250,000 |

Calculate the following ratios before and after adjustments, and explain the impact:
1. Current Ratio
2. Debt-to-Asset Ratio
3. Net Profit Margin

**Solution:**

**Pre-Adjustment Ratios:**
1. Current Ratio = $85,000 ÷ $40,000 = 2.13
2. Debt-to-Asset Ratio = $90,000 ÷ $220,000 = 0.41 or 41%
3. Net Profit Margin = $45,000 ÷ $250,000 = 0.18 or 18%

**Post-Adjustment Ratios:**
1. Current Ratio = $78,000 ÷ $48,000 = 1.63
2. Debt-to-Asset Ratio = $98,000 ÷ $213,000 = 0.46 or 46%
3. Net Profit Margin = $30,000 ÷ $250,000 = 0.12 or 12%

**Impact Analysis:**
- **Current Ratio**: Decreased from 2.13 to 1.63, indicating a 24% reduction in short-term liquidity. This suggests the company's ability to pay short-term obligations is weaker than initially presented.
- **Debt-to-Asset Ratio**: Increased from 41% to 46%, showing higher financial leverage and risk than pre-adjustment figures indicated.
- **Net Profit Margin**: Decreased from 18% to 12%, a significant 33% reduction in profitability. The adjustments revealed substantially lower profitability than pre-adjustment data suggested.

**Conclusion**: The adjustments revealed a company with lower liquidity, higher leverage, and lower profitability than the unadjusted numbers indicated. This demonstrates the importance of proper adjustments for accurate financial analysis.

### Problem 5: Reversing Entries

**Problem:**  
On December 31, 2023, WebDev Services made the following year-end adjusting entries:

1. Dr. Wage Expense $5,800, Cr. Wages Payable $5,800 (for wages earned but not paid)
2. Dr. Interest Receivable $1,200, Cr. Interest Revenue $1,200 (for interest earned but not received)
3. Dr. Supplies Expense $2,400, Cr. Supplies $2,400 (for supplies used)

Prepare the appropriate reversing entries on January 1, 2024, if any, and explain why some adjusting entries should be reversed while others should not.

**Solution:**

**January 1, 2024 Reversing Entries:**

1. Wages accrual reversal:
   ```
   Dr. Wages Payable         5,800
       Cr. Wage Expense           5,800
   ```

2. Interest accrual reversal:
   ```
   Dr. Interest Revenue      1,200
       Cr. Interest Receivable    1,200
   ```

3. Supplies adjustment - No reversing entry needed

**Explanation:**

- **Accrued wages**: A reversing entry is useful here because in January, when the wages are actually paid, the accounting system can simply debit Wage Expense and credit Cash for the full amount. Without the reversing entry, the accountant would need to split the payment between Wages Payable (for the December portion) and Wage Expense (for the January portion).

- **Accrued interest**: Similarly, when the interest is received in January, the system can record a straightforward debit to Cash and credit to Interest Revenue. Without the reversing entry, the receipt would require a more complex entry involving Interest Receivable.

- **Supplies**: No reversing entry is needed because the adjustment permanently reduced the Supplies account to its actual remaining balance. Future supplies purchases will be recorded as new debits to the Supplies account.

**Impact on January Transactions:**

When wages are paid in January:
- With reversing entry: Dr. Wage Expense, Cr. Cash (simple)
- Without reversing entry: Dr. Wages Payable and Dr. Wage Expense (for new portion), Cr. Cash (more complex)

When interest is received in January:
- With reversing entry: Dr. Cash, Cr. Interest Revenue (simple)
- Without reversing entry: Dr. Cash, Cr. Interest Receivable and Cr. Interest Revenue (for new portion) (more complex)

### Problem 6: Statement of Cash Flows Impact of Adjustments

**Problem:**  
TechCorp had the following adjusted account balances and changes during 2023:

| Account | Jan 1, 2023 | Dec 31, 2023 | Change |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Accounts Receivable | $45,000 | $52,000 | +$7,000 |
| Prepaid Expenses | $12,000 | $9,000 | -$3,000 |
| Accounts Payable | $38,000 | $42,000 | +$4,000 |
| Accrued Expenses | $8,000 | $11,000 | +$3,000 |
| Depreciation Expense | - | $15,000 | +$15,000 |
| Net Income | - | $85,000 | +$85,000 |

Prepare the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows using the indirect method, and explain the impact of each adjustment on cash flow.

**Solution:**

```
TechCorp
Statement of Cash Flows (Operating Activities - Indirect Method)
For the Year Ended December 31, 2023

Net Income                                           $85,000

Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash
provided by operating activities:
  Depreciation                                        15,000
  Increase in Accounts Receivable                    (7,000)
  Decrease in Prepaid Expenses                         3,000
  Increase in Accounts Payable                         4,000
  Increase in Accrued Expenses                         3,000
Total Adjustments                                    $18,000

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities           $103,000
```

**Explanation of Impact:**

- **Net Income ($85,000)**: Starting point for indirect method
- **Depreciation ($15,000)**: Added back because it's a non-cash expense that reduced net income
- **Increase in Accounts Receivable (-$7,000)**: Subtracted because it represents revenue recognized but not yet collected in cash
- **Decrease in Prepaid Expenses ($3,000)**: Added because it represents cash paid in a previous period that was expensed in the current period
- **Increase in Accounts Payable ($4,000)**: Added because it represents expenses recognized but not yet paid in cash
- **Increase in Accrued Expenses ($3,000)**: Added because it represents expenses recognized but not yet paid in cash

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
While the company reported $85,000 in net income, its actual cash generated from operations was $103,000. The adjustments reveal that the company's cash flow position is stronger than the income statement alone would suggest, primarily due to non-cash expenses (depreciation) and favorable changes in working capital.

### Problem 7: Detecting Accounting Errors Through Adjustment Analysis

**Problem:**  
The following errors were discovered after QuickWeb Inc. prepared its unadjusted trial balance on December 31, 2023:

1. A $3,000 payment for insurance on December 1, 2023, covering six months, was debited entirely to Insurance Expense.
2. A $4,800 payment received in advance for a 12-month service contract starting December 15, 2023, was credited entirely to Service Revenue.
3. $2,500 of December sales on account were not recorded until January 2024.
4. Depreciation of $1,800 on equipment was not recorded.
5. $1,000 in salaries for December 30-31 was not accrued (to be paid January 15, 2024).

Prepare correcting entries and explain the impact on the financial statements if these errors are not corrected.

**Solution:**

**Correcting Entries:**

1. Insurance correction:
   ```
   Dr. Prepaid Insurance       2,500
       Cr. Insurance Expense       2,500
   (To reclassify unexpired insurance: $3,000 × 5/6 = $2,500)
   ```

2. Unearned revenue correction:
   ```
   Dr. Service Revenue        4,600
       Cr. Unearned Revenue       4,600
   (To reclassify unearned portion: $4,800 × 11.5/12 = $4,600)
   ```

3. Missing sales:
   ```
   Dr. Accounts Receivable    2,500
       Cr. Sales Revenue          2,500
   (To record December sales)
   ```

4. Missing depreciation:
   ```
   Dr. Depreciation Expense   1,800
       Cr. Accumulated Depreciation   1,800
   (To record depreciation)
   ```

5. Salary accrual:
   ```
   Dr. Salary Expense         1,000
       Cr. Salaries Payable       1,000
   (To accrue unpaid salaries)
   ```

**Impact If Not Corrected:**

| Error | Assets | Liabilities | Equity | Revenue | Expenses | Net Income |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
| 1. Insurance | Understated by $2,500 | No effect | Understated by $2,500 | No effect | Overstated by $2,500 | Understated by $2,500 |
| 2. Unearned Revenue | No effect | Understated by $4,600 | Overstated by $4,600 | Overstated by $4,600 | No effect | Overstated by $4,600 |
| 3. Missing Sales | Understated by $2,500 | No effect | Understated by $2,500 | Understated by $2,500 | No effect | Understated by $2,500 |
| 4. Depreciation | Overstated by $1,800 | No effect | Overstated by $1,800 | No effect | Understated by $1,800 | Overstated by $1,800 |
| 5. Salary Accrual | No effect | Understated by $1,000 | Understated by $1,000 | No effect | Understated by $1,000 | Overstated by $1,000 |
| **Net Impact** | **Understated by $3,200** | **Understated by $5,600** | **Understated by $2,400** | **Overstated by $2,100** | **Understated by $4,500** | **Overstated by $6,600** |

**Summary of Financial Statement Impact:**
- **Balance Sheet**: Assets understated by $3,200, Liabilities understated by $5,600, resulting in Equity being overstated by $2,400
- **Income Statement**: Revenue overstated by $2,100, Expenses understated by $4,500, resulting in Net Income being overstated by $6,600
- **Overall**: The errors would significantly overstate profitability while presenting an inaccurate picture of the company's financial position
