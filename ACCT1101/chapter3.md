# Chapter 3: Operating Decisions

## Revenue Recognition
- Revenue recognized when earned, regardless of when cash is received
- Must be measurable and collection reasonably assured

## Revenue Recognition Examples

### Product Sale
```
May 15: Customer orders $1,000 of goods
May 20: Goods shipped to customer, invoice sent
May 30: Payment received

Recognition point: May 20 (when shipped)
Dr. Accounts Receivable      1,000
    Cr. Sales Revenue             1,000
```

### Service Contract
```
Jan 1: Receive $12,000 for 12-month service contract
Each month: Recognize 1/12 of revenue

Dr. Cash                     12,000
    Cr. Unearned Revenue          12,000

Monthly journal entry:
Dr. Unearned Revenue          1,000
    Cr. Service Revenue           1,000
```

## Expense Recognition (Matching Principle)
- Expenses matched with related revenues
- Expenses recognized when incurred, not necessarily when paid

## Matching Principle Illustrated

### Salesperson Commission
```
December sales: $100,000
Commission rate: 5%
Commissions paid in January

December entry (matching):
Dr. Commission Expense       5,000
    Cr. Commissions Payable       5,000
```

## Accrual vs. Cash Basis
- **Accrual**: Records transactions when they occur economically
- **Cash**: Records only when cash changes hands
- GAAP requires accrual accounting for most entities

## Accrual vs. Cash Basis Comparison

| Transaction | Accrual Basis | Cash Basis |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Services performed but not yet billed | Record revenue | No entry |
| Advance payment received for future service | Record as liability | Record as revenue |
| Supplies purchased on account | Record expense and liability | No entry |
| Salary expense incurred but not paid | Record expense and liability | No entry |

## Operating Cycle
- Purchase inventory → Sell goods → Collect receivables
- Influences working capital management

## Operating Cycle Visualization

```
[Cash] → [Inventory] → [Accounts Receivable] → [Cash]

### Timing Example
- Purchase inventory (Day 1): $5,000
- Sell on account (Day 30): $8,000
- Collect payment (Day 60): $8,000
- Operating cycle: 60 days
