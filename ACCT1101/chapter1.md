## Key Financial Statements

### Income Statement
- **Purpose**: Shows profitability over time
- **Formula**: Revenue - Expenses = Net Income
- **Example**:
  ```
  Apple Inc. Income Statement (simplified)
  Revenue                $365.8B
  Cost of Sales         ($212.9B)
  Operating Expenses     ($87.7B)
  Net Income             $65.2B
  ```

### Balance Sheet
- **Purpose**: Financial position at a point in time
- **Formula**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- **Example**:
  ```
  Tesla Balance Sheet (simplified)
  Assets:
    Cash               $17.1B
    Inventory          $5.8B
    PPE                $21.6B
    Total Assets       $62.1B
  
  Liabilities:
    Accounts Payable   $10.1B
    Debt               $9.7B

  Equity:              $31.6B
  ```

### Cash Flow Statement

  Financing Activities    -$39.3B
  Net Change in Cash      +$6.6B
  ```

## Accounting Equation in Action
A = L + E
- **Starting**: Assets $10,000 = Liabilities $4,000 + Equity $6,000
- **Purchase $2,000 equipment on credit**: Assets $12,000 = Liabilities $6,000 + Equity $6,000
- **Earn $3,000 revenue**: Assets $15,000 = Liabilities $6,000 + Equity $9,000
