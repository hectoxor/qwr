#### **Key Learning Objectives**  
1. **Understand the Four Basic Financial Statements**:  
   - **Balance Sheet**: Snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity at a point in time.  
   - **Income Statement**: Performance over a period (revenues - expenses = net income).  
   - **Statement of Stockholders’ Equity**: Changes in equity (common stock and retained earnings).  
   - **Statement of Cash Flows**: Cash inflows/outflows categorized into operating, investing, and financing activities.  
2. **Role of GAAP**: Rules governing financial reporting, enforced by the SEC and formulated by FASB.  

---

#### **Users of Financial Information**  
- **External Users**: Investors, creditors, regulators, customers.  
- **Internal Users**: Managers, employees (e.g., marketing, HR).  

---

#### **Four Basic Financial Statements**  
1. **Balance Sheet**  
   - **Equation**: Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity  
   - **Assets**: Resources owned (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory, PPE).  
   - **Liabilities**: Obligations (e.g., accounts payable, notes payable).  
   - **Equity**: Common stock + Retained Earnings.  
   - **Structure**: Assets listed by liquidity; liabilities by maturity.  

2. **Income Statement**  
   - **Equation**: Revenues - Expenses = Net Income  
   - **Revenues**: Sales, fees, interest.  
   - **Expenses**: COGS, wages, depreciation, taxes.  
   - **Accrual Basis**: Recognize revenues/expenses when earned/incurred (not when cash is exchanged).  

3. **Statement of Stockholders’ Equity**  
   - **Components**:  
     - *Common Stock*: Investments by shareholders.  
     - *Retained Earnings*: Net income - dividends.  
   - **Formula**:  
     - Ending Retained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends.  

4. **Statement of Cash Flows**  
   - **Categories**:  
     - Operating (day-to-day activities),  
     - Investing (buying/selling assets),  
     - Financing (debt/equity transactions).  

---

#### **Key Concepts**  
- **GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)**:  
  - Formulated by FASB; ensures consistency and accuracy.  
  - SEC oversees compliance for public companies.  
- **Accrual vs. Cash Basis**:  
  - **Accrual**: Records transactions when earned/incurred (required for public companies).  
  - **Cash Basis**: Records transactions when cash is exchanged (used by small businesses).  

---

#### **Business Entities**  
1. **Sole Proprietorship**: Owned by one person; unlimited liability.  
2. **Partnership**: Owned by multiple individuals; shared liability.  
3. **Corporation**:  
   - *Advantages*: Limited liability, continuity, ease of ownership transfer.  
   - *Disadvantage*: Double taxation (corporate income + dividends taxed).  

---

#### **Self-Study Highlights**  
- **Balance Sheet Example** (Le-Nature’s Inc.): Total assets ($527.4M) = Liabilities ($407.7M) + Equity ($119.7M).  
- **Income Statement Recognition**: Sales revenue ($275.1M) recognized when goods/services are delivered, not when cash is received.  
- **Retained Earnings Calculation**:  
  - Ending RE = Beginning RE + Net Income - Dividends.  

---

#### **Important Notes**  
- **Footnotes**: Integral part of financial statements; provide context and details (e.g., accounting policies, contingencies).  
- **Financial Analysis**: Creditors focus on liquidity and debt repayment ability; investors focus on profitability and growth.  

---

**Summary**: Financial statements are tools for decision-making. Understanding their structure, content, and the principles behind them (GAAP) is critical for evaluating a company’s financial health.

## Key Financial Statements

### Income Statement
- **Purpose**: Shows profitability over time
- **Formula**: Revenue - Expenses = Net Income
- **Example**:
  ```
  Apple Inc. Income Statement (simplified)
  Revenue                $365.8B
  Cost of Sales         ($212.9B)
  Operating Expenses     ($87.7B)
  Net Income             $65.2B
  ```

### Balance Sheet
- **Purpose**: Financial position at a point in time
- **Formula**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- **Example**:
  ```
  Tesla Balance Sheet (simplified)
  Assets:
    Cash               $17.1B
    Inventory          $5.8B
    PPE                $21.6B
    Total Assets       $62.1B
  
  Liabilities:
    Accounts Payable   $10.1B
    Debt               $9.7B
    Total Liabilities  $30.5B
  
  Equity:              $31.6B
  ```

### Cash Flow Statement
- **Three Sections**: Operating, Investing, Financing
- **Example**:
  ```
  Microsoft Cash Flows (simplified)
  Operating Activities    +$76.1B
  Investing Activities    -$30.2B
  Financing Activities    -$39.3B
  Net Change in Cash      +$6.6B
  ```

## Accounting Equation in Action
A = L + E
- **Starting**: Assets $10,000 = Liabilities $4,000 + Equity $6,000
- **Purchase $2,000 equipment on credit**: Assets $12,000 = Liabilities $6,000 + Equity $6,000
- **Earn $3,000 revenue**: Assets $15,000 = Liabilities $6,000 + Equity $9,000

## Key Stakeholders
- **Investors**: ROI, EPS, P/E ratio
- **Creditors**: Debt-to-equity, interest coverage
- **Management**: Profitability, operational efficiency
- **Regulators**: Compliance with standards
