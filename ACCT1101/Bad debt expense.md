# Bad Debt Expense in Financial Accounting

## Definition
Bad debt expense represents the estimated amount of accounts receivable that a company expects will become uncollectible during an accounting period.

## Key Concepts

### Accounts Receivable (A/R)
- Money owed by customers for goods/services sold on credit
- Reported as a current asset on the balance sheet
- Example: Customer buys $1,000 of goods on credit
  - Debit: Accounts Receivable $1,000
  - Credit: Sales Revenue $1,000

### Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
- A contra-asset account that reduces the value of Accounts Receivable
- Represents estimated uncollectible amounts
- Balance sheet shows:
  ```
  Accounts Receivable        $100,000
  Less: Allowance            ($5,000)
  Net Accounts Receivable     $95,000
  ```

## Methods for Estimating Bad Debt Expense

### 1. Percentage of Sales Method
- Based on historical relationship between credit sales and bad debts
- Example:
  ```
  Annual credit sales: $500,000
  Historical bad debt rate: 2%
  Estimated bad debt expense: $500,000 × 2% = $10,000
  ```

### 2. Aging of Accounts Receivable Method
- Groups A/R by age and applies different percentages
- Example:
  ```
  Current:        $10,000 × 1%  = $100
  31-60 days:    $5,000 × 5%   = $250
  61-90 days:    $3,000 × 20%  = $600
  Over 90 days:  $2,000 × 50%  = $1,000
  Total estimated bad debts:    $1,950
  ```

## Journal Entries

### 1. Recording Bad Debt Expense
```
Debit: Bad Debt Expense            $1,000
Credit: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  $1,000
```

### 2. Writing Off an Account
When a specific account is deemed uncollectible:
```
Debit: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  $500
Credit: Accounts Receivable              $500
```

### 3. Recovery of Written-Off Account
If customer later pays a previously written-off account:
```
Step 1: Reverse the write-off
Debit: Accounts Receivable              $500
Credit: Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  $500

Step 2: Record the payment
Debit: Cash                            $500
Credit: Accounts Receivable             $500
```

## Financial Statement Impact

### Income Statement
- Bad debt expense reduces net income
- Appears under operating expenses
- Example:
  ```
  Sales Revenue          $100,000
  Operating Expenses:
    Bad Debt Expense     ($2,000)
    Other Expenses      ($78,000)
  Net Income            $20,000
  ```

### Balance Sheet
- Allowance for doubtful accounts reduces A/R
- Net A/R = Gross A/R - Allowance
- Example:
  ```
  Current Assets:
    Cash               $50,000
    Accounts Receivable $40,000
    Less: Allowance    ($2,000)
    Net A/R            $38,000
  ```

## Important Principles

1. **Matching Principle**
   - Bad debt expense should be recorded in same period as related sales
   - Ensures expenses match with revenues they helped generate

2. **Conservatism**
   - Better to overestimate bad debts than underestimate
   - Prevents overstatement of assets and net income

3. **Materiality**
   - Level of detail in estimation should reflect significance
   - Large companies need more sophisticated estimation methods

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Timing Issues**
   - Don't wait until accounts are actually uncollectible
   - Estimate and record expense in period of related sales

2. **Direct Write-off Method**
   - Only acceptable for tax purposes or immaterial amounts
   - Violates matching principle
   - Doesn't provide allowance for future losses

3. **Percentage Confusion**
   - Don't apply same percentage to all accounts
   - Consider aging, customer history, economic conditions
